Image shows Rob Reiner tweeted in 2023 that he would stop posting until “Trump goes to prison.”,Unknown,"By Maria Briceño • December 17, 2025",false,1,"A day after director Rob Reiner and wife Michele Reiner were found dead in their California home, a purported tweet from the Hollywood star resurfaced on social media. ""Until Trump goes to prison I will no longer be posting on Twitter,"" read an image of what looks like a Jan. 20, 2023, post from Reiner on the platform that has since been renamed X. ""I've had it with the insults and put downs."" It goes on to use expletives directed at ""MAGA."" Conservative influencer Laura Loomer wasamongthesocialmediausersto share the image online.

""Naturally, his son was also a loser, and he got addicted to drugs and allegedly murdered his parents."" Her comments followed President Donald Trumpcriticizing Reiner as ""deranged""and linking the director’s death to his liberal political beliefs.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has raised taxes.,Unknown,"By Jill Terreri Ramos • December 11, 2025",half-true,0,"Rep. Elise Stefanik began her campaign to unseat Gov. Kathy Hochul by claiming the Democratic incumbent has raised taxes. Stefanik, a Republican,said in a Fox News interview that Hochul is""open to raising taxes, on top of the taxes she’s already raised for New Yorkers."" Hochul says shewill not raise personal income taxesin her next budget proposal, due in January, though she has not ruled out raising corporate taxes. We checked Stefanik’s claim that Hochul has raised taxes. Since Hochul’s swearing in as governor in August 2021, she has proposed and negotiated budgets in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. She frequently talks about maintaining the lowest middle-class personal income tax rate in 70 years in the state, and while we have rated a similar claimMostly True,PolitiFact has covered the problemswith comparing tax rates across decades. Going into her first budget, she benefitted from tax increases on high-income earnersand businessesthat took effect in 2021, before she became governor. These increases led to strong tax collections in her first year in office. There have been some tax increases during her tenure, and extensions of existing taxes, though many of these actions affect only certain tax filers, such as high income earners, some corporations, New York City businesses with large payrolls, and smokers. An extension of a tax dating back to the mid-1990s is broader,affecting people who purchase health insurance. The budgetenacted in Aprilincluded one of the more significant tax increase extensions. A tax increase for the state’s highest earners that had been enacted as a temporary measure in 2021 was extended for five years. This affects married couples who file jointly with taxable incomes above $2.2 million. But this increase was paired with a counter measure for people in the lowest five tax brackets. Personal income tax rates went down for married couples earning $323,000 or less, according to ananalysisfrom the Empire Center, a conservative think tank. The 2023-24 budget also included anextension of an increasein the corporate franchise tax rate until 2027. Businesses with incomes ofmore than $5 millionbegan paying 7.25% in 2021, and that rate was extended in the budget passed in 2023. The budget also increased the top rate of a tax that funds public transportation, known as the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax.. This top rate increased foremployers and self-employed workers in the five counties of New York City, and it was meant to fund operations for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which saw steep declines in ridership during the pandemic. Employers and individuals in the seven other downstate counties contained in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District were not affected by the change. In the budget passed in 2023, there was anextension of a tax on health insurance, known as Health Care Reform Act taxes. These taxes have beenextended routinely since 1996, and add hundreds of dollars per year to the cost of health insurance for the average family, according to the Empire Center. This is the state’s third-largest revenue source after income and sales taxes. In 2025,taxes that fund public transportation, known as the payroll mobility tax, went up by less than 1 percentage point on downstate companies with payrolls of more than $10 million, butwent down for smaller employersand were eliminated for self-employed workers making $150,000 or less. Revenue was reinvested in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. There were much narrower tax changes too, such as a $1 increase in excise taxes on packs ofcigarettesandlittle cigarsin 2023, which only affect smokers. In 2025, the state levieda tax on group health plans, known as the managed care tax, which the conservative Empire Center called""a tactic for exploiting Medicaid’s financing system.""The tax wasintended to be revenue-neutralfor managed care organizations, which receive other payments from the state, and were levied to draw in more federal revenue to the state. The federal governmenthas told the stateit must end the tax in March. We approached Stefanik’s campaign for evidence of her claim, which provided some of the examples mentioned above. Representatives from Hochul’s office maintain extensions of existing taxes are not tax increases, and that it’s standard for changes in the tax code to be subject to renewal. Hochul’s office said that it’s not correct to call the increased rates for high income earners enacted in 2021 under Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""temporary."" However,in a review of the 2021-22 budget, the Office of the State Comptroller noted that the top rate will increase from 8.82% to as much as 10.9%: ""The change will be in effect for tax years 2021 through 2027; in 2028 and thereafter, the rate will revert to 8.82 percent."" The 2027 expiration was also described in Cuomo’sbudget materials at the time. E.J. McMahon, adjunct fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, called Hochul’s pre-emptive extension (it was passed in 2025 instead of 2027) ""a tax increase by any standard."" ""If she had done nothing, it would have ended two years from now,"" McMahon said. Hochul’s spokespeople also point to actions that reduced taxes on New Yorkers, including accelerating middle-class tax cuts to fully implement them in 2023 instead of 2025, and child tax credits for low- to moderate-income families. They also noted inflation refund checks for low- to moderate-income filers. It’s a toll, not a tax, and therefore does not affect the rating of this claim, but we will note that perhaps the most controversial fee enacted during Hochul’s administration is congestion pricing, in which vehicles are charged for entering areas of Manhattan south of 60th Street. Hochul haspraised the program, which took effect in January, for reducing congestion, increasing transit ridership and raising money for regional transit improvements. Hochul, backed by the State Legislature, has extended existing taxes for wealthy corporations and individuals, as well as health insurance companies.She has also cut taxes for the middle class. Other new increases, such as transit taxes on large businesses, were paired with cuts for smaller businesses. Stefanik claimed Hochul has raised taxes on New Yorkers. That claim could lead every New Yorker to believe their taxes have gone up because of Hochul. But the new tax increases did not affect every New Yorker, and income taxes on the middle classwent down. Extensions mostly affected select groups. A broad tax on health insurance was extended, but that has been in place since 1996. This claim has some truth to it, but it lacks important context.

The U.S. has received promises of investments totaling $18 trillion to $22 trillion since January.,Unknown,"By Louis Jacobson • December 9, 2025",false,1,"President Donald Trump has often said that since he took office in January, the U.S. has received trillions of dollars in promises of investments, and the dollar amount he cites changes. On his second day in office,Jan. 21, Trump said the U.S. had ""already secured nearly $3 trillion of new investments."" ByMay 8, that figure rose to ""close to $10 trillion."" It eventually peakedOct. 29during a meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-seok: ""I think by the end of my first term, we should have $21 or $22 trillion dollars invested in the United States from other people and countries,"" Trump said. Since then, Trump has reported varied investment figures: OnNov. 27andDec. 2, he said they were worth nearly $20 trillion. OnDec. 2,Dec. 3,Dec. 4andDec. 9, he said about $18 trillion, a figure he had first citedOct. 10. Sometimes Trump has phrased the commitments as approaching a dollar figure; other times, he’s said they’ve already hit that number. In May, when Trump said, ""We have now close to $10 trillion"" in investments, we rated thatFalse. The White House had documented at least $4.9 trillion less than what Trump claimed. That $10 trillion number has about doubled in the seven months since, according to Trump, but it’s unsubstantiated. On the higher end, $22 trillion would be equal to about three-quarters of the United States’ entire 2024 annualgross domestic product, an extraordinary total for the richest country in the history of the world. The White House website documents $9.6 trillion, and not everything cited on the website was newly pledged during Trump’s second term. Experts say there’s no guarantee the full amounts promised will come to fruition, and some of this investment would have occurred regardless of who was president. The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions about Trump’s statements. One way to benchmark Trump’s investment figure is to look at what the White House officially documented. The White House launched aweb pagein April that includes a list of countries and companies it said have announced investments during Trump’s second term. Using the internet archive Wayback Machine, we tracked the amount of investment the White House website cited over time. The figures Trump has used were usually at least double the amount listed on the website. In recent weeks, as Trump cited figures from $18 trillion to $22 trillion, the White House website reported $9.6 trillion. The White House website’s figure includes aspirational goals over multiple years and counts future purchases of products rather than capital investments. For some of the biggest line items — such as commitments by the governments of the United Arab Emirates and Qatar — the pledges are multiple times those countries’ annual gross domestic product, which calls their feasibility into question. A Bloomberg Economics’analysisfound that of the $9.6 trillion the White House listed on its website in late November, $7 trillion could be considered ""real investment pledges."" The remaining $2.6 trillion included countries’ agreements to purchase items such as natural gas or to expand future trade. The analysis characterized some of the investment pledges by other countries as ""amorphous."" More than 80% of the investments from private companies stemmed from artificial intelligence-related spending. ""Many of the pledges cited by the White House are part of overlapping multi-company projects, making it difficult to determine how much may be counted more than once,"" Bloomberg said. Ten items on the White House's website accounted for the vast majority of the $9.6 trillion the White House detailed. Some of the White House’s documentation includes details such as specific companies getting involved and the types of facilities or infrastructure envisioned; other examples are more vague. Some involve conventional investments, while others have to do with projected trade increases. 1.United Arab Emirates: $1.4 trillion. TheWhite Housesays this investment focuses on AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, quantum computing, biotechnology and manufacturing. Companies cited in a White House news release include Boeing, GE Aerospace, Emirates Global Aluminum, ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Qualcomm and Amazon Web Services. It’sunclearhow much of this investment would come from new investments. The UAE’s 2024gross domestic productwas $537 billion, making the pledge equal to three years of the country’s entire economic output. 2.Qatar: $1.2 trillion. TheWhite Housepress release described this as an ""economic exchange,"" rather than one-way investment. It cited the involvement of companies including Boeing, GE Aerospace, Raytheon, General Atomics, ExxonMobil and Chevron Phillips. The announcement described a mixture of trade deals, purchase agreements and investment intentions — items thatanalystssay often include future-looking efforts rather than capital injections. In 2024, Qatar’sgross domestic productwas $218 billion, making this pledge equivalent to nearly six years of the country’s entire economy. 3.Japan: $1 trillion. The White Househas saidJapan is moving toward $1 trillion, following aninitialagreement toinvest$550 billion in sectors such as semiconductors, shipbuilding, energy, pharmaceuticals, metals and minerals by the end of Trump’s term. Japan also disputes that this will be a one-way flow of cash into the U.S. Bloomberg NewsquotedJapanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa saying, ""It’s not that $550 billion in cash will be sent to the U.S."" but rather a combination of investments, loans and loan guarantees provided by financial institutions backed by the Japanese government. 4.Meta: $600 billion. The White House and the social mediacompanysaid $600 billion istied toMeta’s U.S. AI infrastructure and workforceexpansionplans through 2028. 5.Apple: $600 billion. Apple’s long history of multi-year domestic investment pledgesmeansthe $600 billion figure incorporates prior commitmentsplusrecent accelerations. Apple’snews releasedescribed a new $100 billion boost to bring its total U.S. commitment to $600 billion over several years. The release cites a new American Manufacturing Program, supplier investments and training programs. 6.Saudi Arabia: $600 billion. Theadministrationsaid $600 billion from Saudi Arabia would involve the energy, critical minerals and defense sectors. (The most recent White House news release says this figure has increased to $1 billion, but this is not yet reflected on the White House investment web page.) The amount cited would be equal to about half of Saudi Arabia’s 2024 gross domestic product. 7.European Union companies: $600 billion. The EUsaidin August that ""European companies are expected to invest an additional $600 billion across strategic sectors in the United States through 2028."" However, the statement frames this as aspirational, not as a commitment. 8.Stargate: $500 billion. This consortium between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle was unveiled during a Jan. 21 White House event. Stargatesaid$100 billion will be invested ""immediately"" and that the consortium ""intends to invest"" a total of $500 billion over the next four years. OpenAI among others published blog posts describing its plans for five new sites that would bring the project to""over $400 billion""in near-term investment, positioning it on a path to the $500 billion target. 9.NVIDIA: $500 billion. TheWhite Housesaid NVIDIA has pledged to build $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. NVIDIA has said it is pursuing ""ambitious"" manufacturing and server production in the U.S., but the $500 billion figure remains a goal. 10.India: $500 billion. What is being called ""Mission 500"" aims to reach $500 billion in annual bilateral trade by2030. But it is a tradegoal, not an investment pledge, and its end date would come after the end of Trump’s term. Further, the framework seems to allow U.S. purchases of Indian goods to count toward the goal, which does not foster U.S. investment and production. Importantly, experts said, some of these pledges won’t materialize. ""Historically, large-scale investment announcements often overpromise and underdeliver,"" Roman V. Yampolskiy, an AI specialist at the University of Louisvilletold PolitiFactin May. ""There is a performative element to them, especially in politically charged contexts. They function as political theater as much as economic commitment."" Trump isn’t the first to overstate new investments. President Joe Biden said in 2024 that his bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act had attracted $640 billion in private investments;economists told PolitiFactthat Biden’s numbers were based on what companies had announced, which is not the same as dollars already spent. Trump says the U.S. has received investment commitments totaling $18 trillion to $22 trillion since he took office in January. The number Trump cites is about double what the White House’s website lists. And experts say the website’s current figure, $9.6 trillion, should be viewed with caution. It includes aspirational, multi-year goals that might or might not come to fruition, and some items are future purchases or sales of products, rather than capital investments. For the two biggest line items — commitments from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar — the amounts are multiple times those countries’ annual gross domestic product.

“I take responsibility for putting people in jail” in Minnesota fraud scandal.,Unknown,"By Amy Sherman • December 5, 2025",false,1,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz recently faced questions about a state fraud scandal involving Somalis that spawned a feud between him and President Donald Trump. The scandal, outlined in aNov. 29 articlein The New York Times, centered on a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future that received federal funding to feed low-income children. NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker asked Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, on Nov. 30 about the schemes mentioned in the article that involved people convicted in Minnesota for stealing taxpayer money during the pandemic. Welker asked Walz: ""Do you take responsibility for failing to stop this fraud in your state?"" The governor replied, ""Well, certainly, I take responsibility for putting people in jail. Governors don't get to just talk theoretically. We have to solve problems."" His statement gives the impression that state officials were on the front lines of prosecuting historic fraud. That’s not what happened. Federal prosecutors led the investigations and brought the charges. We asked Walz for evidence the governor was responsible for convictions. ""Prosecutions don’t materialize out of thin air,"" Walz spokesperson Claire Lancaster said. State officials cited Minnesota agencies’ work, including by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, whose laboratory provided forensic testing on evidence. Jen Longaecker, a Minnesota Department of Public Safety spokesperson, pointed to the bureau’s role inidentifying fingerprintson a gift bag used in a Feeding Our Future juror bribery scheme. But that case was an offshoot of the initial fraud investigation. Trump cited the scandal as a reason to end Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota,writingNov. 21 on Truth Social, ""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing."" Temporary Protected Status is for people from certain countries experiencing war, natural disasters or epidemics and protects them from deportation. There are about700 Somalisin the U.S. with TPS, many in Minnesota.Immigration lawyerssaid it isn’t possible to take away the status state by state. Before Trump vowed to do that, the TPS program for Somalis across the U.S. was already set to expire inMarch 2026. An estimated100,000people who identify as Somali live in Minnesota and the majority are U.S. citizens. Many came to the state in the 1990s fleeing a civil war. Trump appeared to be reacting to a recent report from aconservative activistthat said Somalis stole the money to use it for terrorism. That claim, which has circulated since 2018,lacksevidence. In February 2021, the FBI notified the Minnesota Department of Education about kickback allegations involving Feeding Our Future and allegations the group wasn’t providing meals as it said it had. Two months later, the education department notified the FBI that it believed some meal sites were submitting fraudulent documents and inflating the number of children receiving meals. Prosecutors said defendants stole $250 million in federal money and spent it on international vacations, real estate, jewelry and luxury cars. Then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garlandcalled it""the largest pandemic relief fraud scheme."" Feeding Our Future employees recruited people and entities to open sites to feed children, creating shell companies to launder the money. The group existed before the pandemic. But amid COVID-19 school shutdowns, the federal government lifted some requirements about where children could get meals, and afterward the number of meals Feeding Our Future said it served soared. Prosecutors said the defendants exploited those changes and created false documentation such as fake attendance rosters listing how many people had been fed, significantly inflating the numbers. Some state employees raised red flags about the organization, and early in the pandemic, questioned its growth. Then Feeding Our Families sued the state, and ajudge told the stateit had ""a real problem not reimbursing at this stage of the game."" But the judge did not rule on the matter in an April 2021 hearing, and the state resumed paying Feeding Our Future. Walz sought in 2022 to blame the judge for the resumed payments, prompting the judge to issue a statement that the governor was wrong, and the education department had resumed the payments on its own, not because of an order from him, the Minnesota Reformerreportedin 2022. Federal prosecutorsannouncedin September 2022 criminal charges against 47 defendants — a number that eventuallygrew to 78. Federal officialslargely cited the investigative work of federal offices, although they said the state education department cooperated. Most of the defendants were of Somali descent. More than 50 people havepleaded guiltywhile others were convicted at trial, including Feeding Our Future founderAimee Bock, who is not Somali. We found scant mention of state agencies in stories about the investigation dating to 2022. In January 2022, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was working on the investigation along with federal offices, but news accounts largely cited the federal law enforcement work. The FBI had to build its case from scratch, the Star Tribune found, obtaining records from hundreds of bank accounts. Thenewspaper wrotein 2022 that state and federal records showed that ""Minnesota officials provided federal authorities with little or no evidence"" that Feeding Our Future misappropriated government money. TheMinnesota Reformerand theStar Tribunehave reported that state officials could have done more to stop or investigate fraud. Thestate legislative auditorfound in 2024 that the education department provided inadequate oversight and ""could have taken more decisive action sooner."" Mark Osler, a law professor at University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis, told PolitiFact it makes sense that federal authorities led the case given the complexity, involvement of federal money and potential for conflicts of interest for state officials. Osler, a former federal prosecutor, said the state should have detected the fraud earlier. ""The underlying issue isn’t really punishing people later, it is detecting the fraud before it became so large and stopping it,"" he said. During the ""Meet the Press"" interview, Welker mentioned $1 billion in fraud, a cumulative figure spanning many fraud cases, including more recent ones. Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson told local ABC affiliateKSTP-TV in July that he expects the scope of fraud will exceed $1 billion when investigators complete their findings. In September, federal prosecutors charged defendants in schemes misusinghousingfunding and money to provide services for people withautism spectrum disorder. State Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agents continue to work with federal investigators on those cases, Longaecker said. Walz said he took ""responsibility for putting people in jail"" in the Minnesota fraud scandal. The work of federal investigators and prosecutors — not state officials — led to dozens of convictions in the Feeding Our Future scandal. Reporting by media organizations in the state showed that Minnesota officials provided little or no evidence to federal investigators, who had to build a case from scratch, and that the state could have done more to aid the investigation. We rate this statement False. PolitiFact Researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

"Any pardon signed with an autopen is now ""fully and completely terminated, and is of no legal effect.""",Unknown,"By Louis Jacobson • December 4, 2025",false,1,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly said former President Joe Biden signed pardons with an autopen, amechanical devicethat uses a robotic arm with an attached pen. When Trump installed portraits of past presidents in the White House, a photograph of an autopen took the place of Biden’s portrait. On Dec. 2, Trump declared Biden’s pardons, and other actions signed with an autopen, invalid. ""Any and all Documents, Proclamations, Executive Orders, Memorandums, or Contracts, signed by Order of the now infamous and unauthorized ‘AUTOPEN,’ within the Administration of Joseph R. Biden Jr., are hereby null, void, and of no further force or effect,"" Trumpwroteon Truth Social. ""Anyone receiving ‘Pardons,’ ‘Commutations,’ or any other Legal Document so signed, please be advised that said Document has been fully and completely terminated, and is of no Legal effect."" Legal expertspreviously told PolitiFactthat the U.S. Constitution doesn’t require presidents to directly sign pardons. Using a mechanical device for signatures is not prohibited and there is no constitutional mechanism for overturning pardons, they said. ""There is no viable way for the Justice Department to try to revive any impacted criminal charges against pardonees,"" said Bradley Moss, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer. At a minimum, Trump would need to use a more formal process to try to undo Biden's pardons — and then prevail in what would likely be strong legal challenges. ""It is well settled that once there is a pardon, no one — not any president or Congress or the courts — can undo it,"" said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor. When we contacted the White House for comment, a spokesperson pointed us back to Trump’s Truth Social post. In March — after Trump alliescommented onhow similar Biden’s signature appeared across different official documents — Trump turned his attention to Biden’s pardons of lawmakers and others involved with the committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack. The allegation by Trump and his supporters that anonymous aides issued pardons without Biden’s knowledge dovetailed with concerns about Biden’s mental and physical decline at the end of his term, when he was 82 years old, worries that forced him to quit his reelection bid. In a Juneinterviewwith The New York Times, Biden called Trump and other Republicans ""liars"" for saying he didn’t know what he was signing, and for alleging that someone other than him had made the decisions. Biden told The Times he had orally granted all the pardons and commutations issued at the end of his term. ""I made every decision,"" he said, adding that he worked with staff to use an autopen as a way of speeding the process because ""we’re talking about a whole lot of people."" The U.S. Constitution’ section onpardonsdoes not mention the words ""sign"" or ""signature,"" and former presidentsBarack Obama,John F. KennedyandThomas Jeffersonare among those known to have used mechanized signing devices. ""The president possesses the power to pardon, but there is no specification (unlike for signing of bills) that this pardon be in writing,"" Bernadette Meyler, a Stanford University scholar of British and American constitutional law, said in a March email to PolitiFact. Dan Kobil, a Capital Law School professor, said presidents ""historically have not personally signed grants of pardons for every individual they granted clemency to,"" notably when granted in large batches such asmass amnestiesfollowing wars. Government memos from1929and 2005 also supported using an autopen. In 2005, during George W. Bush’s presidency, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel wrote amemothat said: ""The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law. Rather, the President may sign a bill within the meaning of Article I, Section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen."" Potentially reversing pardons would have to begin through a formalized process, not a Truth Social post, legal experts said. Federal authorities would have to rearrest people who had been convicted and pardoned, or try or retry those who hadn’t been charged or convicted. If the government did any of those things, the defendants could sue, and would have some significant legal cards to play. In an1869 ruling, a federal court wrote: ""The law undoubtedly is, that when a pardon is complete, there is no power to revoke it, any more than there is power to revoke any other completed act."" If Trump revoked someone's pardon, that person ""could argue that they have been validly pardoned, and the judge could dismiss the claim then and there,"" Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said. The Justice Department ""would have to prove that Biden did not authorize the pardon."" That would be the longest of courtroom long shots, said Frank O. Bowman III, an emeritus law professor at the University of Missouri, because Biden has said he intended to issue the pardons. ""To me, that's the end of the story,"" Bowman said. History is sprinkled witha fewexamplesof presidents revoking their own pardons before they went into effect, Kobil said. But those about-faces were thanks to a change of heart, not because a subsequent president invalidated them. Trump said any pardon signed by an autopen is now ""fully and completely terminated, and is of no legal effect."" Trump cannot unilaterally make that happen. Legal experts said the Constitution doesn’t require presidents to directly sign pardons or ban using a mechanical device for signatures. There is no constitutional mechanism for overturning pardons. Revoking a prior president’s pardons would be unprecedented, and if people’s pardons are revoked, they could challenge the revocation in court, with legal precedent on their side.

A new North Carolina law “prohibits the use of wireless communication devices while driving.”,Unknown,"By Paul Specht • December 4, 2025",false,1,"A social media account that positions itself as an authority on the North Carolina General Assembly posted false information about the state’s driving laws — triggering a wave of inaccurate news online, and leading to an incorrect artificial intelligence-generated summary on a popular search engine. The Facebook page — called ""North Carolina Legislature"" — posted that ""Effective today, December 1, 2025, North Carolina has a new ‘Hands-Free NC Act’ that prohibits the use of wireless communication devices while driving."" (Screengrab from Facebook) The post, shared more than 3,000 times before being deleted, went on to claim: ""Drivers cannot hold or use a device for tasks like texting or watching videos, though voice-activated technology and factory-installed navigation systems are allowed for most drivers."" Similar claims were subsequently reported by aconservative pundit, a Charlotte-basedtelevision stationand western North Carolinaradio station. On Dec. 2, the day after the post, people who searched ""Hands Free NC"" on Google were shown an ""AI Overview"" saying: ""‘Hands Free NC’ is the new law that went into effect on December 1, 2025, prohibiting drivers from holding or physically using a wireless device while driving, even at a red light."" (Screengrab from Google) The problem with these reports? There is no new law banning people from holding their cell phones while driving. And state lawmakers say despite the ""North Carolina Legislature"" Facebook page’s name, the account isn’t affiliated with the North Carolina legislature. North Carolina law already bans motorists fromsending text or email messageswhile driving. The ""Hands Free NC Act,""  a bipartisan bill filed in March, would allow motorists to be on the phone while driving — as long as they aren’t holding a phone in their hand. However, the bill has not become law, nor has it come up for a vote in the state Senate or state House of Representatives. Sometimes, legislators take a bill’s contents and put its provisions in a more popular bill that’s on its way to becoming law. That didn’t happen with the ""Hands Free"" bill’s contents, lawmakers say. PolitiFact contacted the offices of Senate Leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, and House Speaker Destin Hall, R-Caldwell. We also contacted representatives for Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, whose office oversees auto insurance regulations, and Attorney General Jeff Jackson. Their spokespeople said they were unaware of any new law banning people from holding their phone while driving. ""The ‘Hands-Free NC Act’ was never enacted by the General Assembly and is not in effect,"" said Demi Dowdy, a spokesperson for Hall. State Sen. Jim Burgin, R-Harnett, introduced the bill and told PolitiFact that he has received several phone calls about the Facebook post. Burgin said he regrets having to inform voters that his proposal never actually became law. ""Every day that I go back and forth to Raleigh, I see distracted driving,"" Burgin said in a phone interview. ""At a red light, [when the light turns green] the traffic starts moving and they don't move and their heads are down — you know what they're doing. They're looking at their phone."" The North Carolina Alliance for Safe Transportation, a nonprofit organization that advocates policies that make traveling safer, issued a statement about the Facebook post, saying that it was inaccurate. ""The lesson with this social media post is mistakes happen, which is also the reason motorists should avoid distractions and focus on driving when behind the wheel,"" Joe Stewart, the alliance’s board chairman said in a statement. A PolitiFact reporter messaged the ""North Carolina Legislature"" Facebook page, which says it is ""managed by unpaid volunteers."" We asked for the source of the page’s claim about the ""Hands Free NC Act,"" but page administrators didn’t provide an answer. A Facebook post said the ""Hands-Free NC Act"" went into effect Dec. 1 and ""prohibits the use of wireless communication devices while driving.""

"“This Thanksgiving, turkey prices are at their lowest point since 2000.”",Unknown,"By Paul Specht • November 26, 2025",false,1,"A Republican North Carolina congressman says his party is responsible for sending turkey prices lower than they’ve been in 25 years. ""This Thanksgiving, turkey prices are at their lowest point since 2000, thanks to Republican policies,"" said U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, in a Nov. 24 newsletter. ""I know grocery prices are a concern for so many (of) you,"" he wrote, ""which is why I’m working to keep prices moving in the right direction after the inflationary spike over the last four years."" The newsletter linked to aNov. 19 reportby the American Farm Bureau Federation that doesn’t support his claim. Turkey price data collected by federal agencies — such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, theU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, andFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis— is limited. We struggled to find inflation-adjusted data showing the price of a conventional frozen turkey each November dating back to 2000. However, we found no credible reports showing retail turkey prices hitting a 25-year low in 2025. The farm bureau’s report, which was based on its annual survey of volunteer shoppers, focused on the cost of a 16-pound turkey as a percentage of the total price of a Thanksgiving meal serving 10 people. The meal it priced also consisted of cranberries, sweet potatoes, stuffing and more. A 16-pound turkey costs less this year but didn’t hit a 25-year low for the bureau’s survey, bureau spokesperson Bailey Corwine said. The national average price for a turkey of that size was lower in2019and2020, when prices hit $20.80 and $19.39, respectively. Historically, turkey has accounted for about 40% to 45% of the meal’s total cost, the group’s analysis found. This year, the bureau reported that a turkey of that size costs an average of $21.50, or 39% of the total meal cost. That’s the lowest percentage since 2000, when a turkey accounted for 38.7% of the meal. But the bureau found that’s partly because the prices of other items have risen. Produce prices are up because farmers are facing higher costs for fertilizer, fuel, machinery and labor, the bureau found. The price of sweet potatoes is up 37% from 2024 because Hurricane Helene damaged North Carolina fields, which produce more than half of the nation’s sweet potatoes. Asked about turkey costs, a USDA spokesperson referred us to the department’sweekly reporton retail turkey prices. The Nov. 21 report shows mixed results, with fresh turkey prices down and other turkey prices up since last year. Prices for the most common kind of turkeys in the USDA survey — frozen conventional whole turkeys — were up nationally over last year. The price of a frozen conventional whole turkey weighing less than 16 pounds averaged 96 cents per pound during the week ending Nov. 21, up a penny from a year earlier. Frozen conventional whole turkeys weighing more than 16 pounds cost an average of 99 cents per pound, up from 96 cents a year ago. Other years show lower prices. In November 2008 and 2009, one pound of turkey cost less than 90 cents, a 2010USDA reportshowed. Here’s another wrinkle. Turkey prices are tracked in a number of ways and this year Americans may come across seemingly contradictory headlines: Wholesale prices are up, but retail prices are down in many places. A rise inbird flu casesis diminishing the nation’s turkey stock, raising turkey wholesale prices. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Weekly National Turkey Report from Nov. 14 lists the cost of a whole frozen turkey as$1.77 per poundfor an 8- to 16-pound bird — up from97 cents per poundduring the same week last year, as PolitiFactreported. Some researchers and economistsexpectretailersto pass that increase along to customers. However, many consumers are paying lower prices for turkey than they were last year. One reason: Retailers typically secure their turkey supply months in advance of Thanksgiving, meaning they may have avoided the recent jump in wholesale prices, a USDA spokesperson told PolitiFact in an email. Shoppers can also find lower prices on turkey because retailersoffer dealson Thanksgiving bundles, as PolitiFact recently reported. Grocers are sometimes willing tosell turkeys at a discountif they think they can make up for revenue losses through sales on other products. Shoppers may see turkey prices that are about 16% lower than they were last year, thebureau reported. Datasembly, a market research company that surveys weekly prices at 150,000 U.S. stores, found a 2% decline in the retail price of a 10-pound turkey as of Nov. 17, theAssociated Press reported. TheNov. 21 USDA reporton retail activity found mixed results, with frozen turkeys priced slightly higher than last year and fresh turkeys priced slightly lower. Asked about the claim, a spokesperson for Hudson sent PolitiFact alistofmediaarticlesabout turkey costsdecliningthis year compared to last year, as well as a White Housepress release. However, Hudson’s email response didn’t include proof that turkey prices are at a 25-year-low. Hudson said ""turkey prices are at their lowest point since 2000,"" and cited a report by the American Farm Bureau Federation. The report doesn’t back up his claim. It says the price of a turkey accounts for about 39% of a typical Thanksgiving meal, which is the lowest percentage in 25 years partly because the other items are more expensive. The bureau found the price of a turkey to be lower in other years, such as 2019 and 2020. And the USDA’s most recent report on retail turkey prices found frozen birds to cost slightly more this year than last year.  We rate Hudson’s claim False.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/nov/26/richard-hudson/no-turkey-prices-arent-at-their-lowest-in-25-years/,PolitiFact.com (scraped on 2025-12-18)
"The Trump administration removed nursing from the list of professional degree programs, affecting aspiring nurses’ student loan access.",Unknown,"By Madison Czopek • November 26, 2025",half-true,0,"Reports that a Trump administration change might make it harder for aspiring nurses to pay for their education sparked outrage online. Some social media users said President Donald Trump hadsigned legislation demotingnursing degrees from professional degree status orreclassifying nursing degreesas non-professional degrees. ""The Dept. of Education just removed nursing from the list of ‘professional degree’ programs under the Administration’s new loan rules — a move nurses say threatens the future of patient care,"" radio personality Angela YeewroteNov. 20 on Facebook. Othersocial mediapostspassed on lists of degrees no longer considered ""professional"" under Trump, including nursing and also physical therapy, architecture, accounting, teaching, engineering and social work. Graduate nursing students could soon face new federal borrowing limits, but these comments mislead by saying the Trump administration took nurses’ ""professional"" classification away. Trump’ssweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Actset federal loan borrowing limits for nonprofessional and professional graduate students. The first step in implementing those new loan limits is defining which degrees are ""professional."" An Education Department committee agreed on 11 professional degrees based on an existing definition in federal code; the decision is not final. Nursing was not demoted or removed; it wasn’t on the list of professional degrees to start. However, the changes mean students pursuing graduate degrees in nursing would have a lower borrowing cap compared with borrowers enrolled in professional degrees. The new loan caps don’t affect undergraduate students, and not all nursing jobs require graduate degrees.  Nurse Rod Salaysay plays guitar for patient Richard Hoang in the recovery unit of UC San Diego Health in San Diego, Calif., on Sept. 30, 2025. (AP) One provision inOne Big Beautiful Bill Acteliminated a loan program that allows graduate students to borrow enough money to cover their program’s full cost. That program provided for limitless borrowing, said higher education finance expert and University of Tennessee, Knoxville professor Robert Kelchen. In its place, the Trump-era law implements new federal loan limits beginning July 1, 2026: up to $20,500 every academic year and $100,000 in total for grad students pursuing nonprofessional degrees and up to $50,000 every academic year and $200,000 in total for grad students seeking professional degrees. The law defines professional students as those enrolled in degrees listed infederal code. That section lists examples of professional degrees that ""include but are not limited to"": Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) Dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.) Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.) Chiropractic (D.C. or D.C.M.) Law (L.L.B. or J.D.) Medicine (M.D.) Optometry (O.D.). Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.). Podiatry (D.P.M., D.P., or Pod.D.). Theology (M.Div., or M.H.L.) Nursing was never on that list. But graduate nursing students will be affected by the lower cap for nonprofessional graduate students. ""That distinction did not matter because graduate and professional students largely had the exact same loan limits,"" Kelchen said. ""Now, that distinction matters."" On Nov. 6, a committee charged with implementing the federal student loan changes approved a definition for  ""professional students"" that included the 10 degrees listed in federal code and clinical psychology. The committee also approved anexpanded listof related programs that fall under those fields as ""professional,"" such as forensic psychology and counseling psychology. The public comment period is expected in early 2026, the departmentsaid. The Education Department referred PolitiFact to aNov. 24 ""myth vs. fact"" press release, which said its data shows 95% of nursing students borrow below the yearly loan limits and ""are not affected by the new caps."" Previously, only people seeking advanced nursing degreeswould have qualifiedfor the graduate loan program that had no borrowing limits, known as Graduate PLUS. About 45% of nurses entered the workforce with bachelor’s degrees, according to a March 2024National Center for Health Workforce Analysis report. Some nurses have less than a bachelor’s degree; others start their careers after obtaining advanced degrees. Some nurses choose to pursue a master’s (17%) or doctorate degree (3%) after they start working. Half of nurses said theyused loans, and most nurses used federal student loans to finance their initial nursing degree, thereport said. It typically takes two to three years to earn a nursing master’s degree and roughly five to eight years to earn a doctorate in nursing, Debra Barksdale, president of the American Academy of Nursing, said.  At the University of Michigan's nursing school in Ann Arbor, Mich., instructor Betsy Cambridge, center, talks to students next to a high-fidelity mannequin on March 28, 2016. (AP) Nurse practitioners, who mustcompletemaster’s or doctoral degree programs, fill in some gaps between nurses and doctors. They can perform and interpret diagnostic tests and diagnose and treat some conditions. ""The current demand for master’s- and doctorally-prepared nurses for advanced practice, clinical specialties, teaching and research roles far outstrips the supply,"" Barksdale said. Capping federal loans for graduate nursing programs could result in fewer nurses, Barksdale said. Graduate nursing degree program costs vary. Some historicresearch showsthat by the time nursing students complete their advanced degrees, they have borrowed less than $100,000. It’s unclear how that breaks down year-by-year for the annual $20,500 cap. Of 140 advanced nursing programs with debt data, 115 programs’ data showed their 2019 and 2020 graduates finished degrees with median student debt below $100,000,wrotePreston Cooper, an American Enterprise Institute higher education finance expert. He said lower-cost schooling options exist. Social media posts said the Trump administration removed nursing from the list of professional degree programs, affecting aspiring nurses’ student loan access. A new Trump administration law imposes federal borrowing caps for people pursuing graduate degrees. The borrowing limits are lower for degrees not considered ""professional."" An Education Department committee proposed a definition for ""professional"" that largely relies on an existing federal regulation that never included nursing. Some nursing jobs require no advanced degree, and research shows nurses typically complete their degrees with loan amounts under the new cap. However, the proposed change would put a new burden on nursing graduate students seeking federal loans, because their degrees would not be eligible for the higher ""professional"" cap.

“I have just gotten the highest poll numbers of my ‘political career.’”,Unknown,"By Louis Jacobson • November 24, 2025",false,1,"Is President Donald Trump more popular than ever? He says so. ""I have just gotten the highest poll numbers of my ‘political career,’"" he said in aNov. 22 Truth Social post. Trump’s assertion is inaccurate: Publicly available polling data shows his approval rating at or near its all-time low, not its all-time high. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Polling analysts say the best way to get a snapshot of survey results is to look at aggregations — collections of publicly released polls that average the most recent. A single poll might be an outlier, but averages of all polls decrease the influence of outlier polls. Aggregators’ methods differ, but generally they give the greatest weight to the most recent polls. Many also give greater weight to polls with more accurate track records, and some exclude polls that do not provide sufficient transparency about their methodology. There are eight commonly used aggregators: Nate Silver’sSilver Bulletin;FiftyPlusOne;Decision Desk HQ;RealClearPolitics,The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter;The New York Times;Votehub; andRacetotheWH. Every one of these poll aggregators show Trump’s approval rating has tumbled since the beginning of his second term in January, mirrored by a steady rise in his disapproval rating. Each of the poll aggregators show Trump’s approval rating in positive territory in January, flipping to even approval-disapproval ratings sometime in March. Since then, his disapproval ratings have exceeded approvals by generally increasing amounts.  Decision Desk HQ (screenshot reprinted with permission) Among the seven aggregators publishing since January, Trump’s January approval averaged 54.2% and disapproval 40.8%. By Nov. 24, that flipped. Among the seven aggregators, Trump’s average approval is currently 41.5% and his average disapproval is 56%. ""The high point of his polling was at the beginning of his second term,"" Geoffrey Skelley, chief elections analyst for Decision Desk HQ, told PolitiFact. Trump’s approval and disapproval ratings are currently broadly similar to this point in his first term. In late November 2017, his ratings in the RealClearPolitics aggregation — the only one with public data from both of Trump’s terms — were 39.2% approve and 56.2% disapprove. Today, they are 42.7% approve and 55.9% disapprove. Trump’s approval ratings are also close to the worst point of his first term, which came in mid-December 2017. Back then, according to RealClearPolitics’ average, Trump had 37.2% approval and 58% disapproval. Trump’s polling on specific issues such as the economy, inflation, immigration and trade mirror declines in his overall approval ratings, according toSilver Bulletin. Just because Trump’s polling is at a low point today doesn’t mean it can’t rebound, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. ""Trump has often shown an ability to bounce back from poor approval polling, like water finding its level,"" Kondik said. ""So don't be surprised if he rebounds again — not to positive approval, but perhaps to more like 45% instead of 40%."" Trump wrote, ""I have just gotten the highest poll numbers of my ‘political career.’"" The opposite is true: Eight poll aggregators show Trump had his strongest approval ratings, and his smallest disapproval ratings, in January, at the beginning of his second term. Since then, his approval ratings — both overall and for specific issue areas — have gone consistently downhill. Trump’s current approval and disapproval ratings are the worst of his second term and within a few percentage points of his weakest first-term showing.

"“There’s about 1,400 criminal illegal aliens that, right now, are in North Carolina and Charlotte’s jails that they refuse to turn over to ICE law enforcement.”",Unknown,"By Paul Specht • November 24, 2025",false,1,"A top Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said North Carolina officials are blocking access to more than a thousand people wanted by federal immigration agents. The department deployed Border Patrol agents in Raleigh and Charlotte to apprehend people in the U.S. illegally — anongoingoperation that some local officials criticized as unnecessary. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs for the department, told Fox News that ""sanctuary city politicians"" should let ICE into the area’s jails. ""There’s about 1,400 criminal illegal aliens that, right now, are in North Carolina and Charlotte’s jails that they refuse to turn over to ICE law enforcement,"" she said in a video clip the departmentposted on Xon Nov. 17. PolitiFact found no evidence that 1,400 people in the country illegally are sitting in North Carolina’s jails, or that local law enforcement is refusing to hand them over to federal immigration officials. We emailed the  Department of Homeland Security’s communication team about McLaughlin’s claim. A department spokesperson said ""CBP has no further information to provide."" It’s possible that McLaughlin misspoke. The same figure she mentioned in the Fox News interview — 1,400 — appears in aNov. 15 statementissued by the department. The statement claims that ""nearly 1,400 detainers across North Carolina have not been honored—releasing criminal illegal aliens into North Carolina’s neighborhoods."" A detainer is a request that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sends to locally-operated jails asking law enforcement to hold someone in their custody until federal agents arrive to pick them up. It is used even if the person posts bail and even if the suspect has only been charged — but not convicted — of a crime. The DHS statement doesn’t say whether those detainers were ignored this year, last year or over the span of many years. McLaughlin’s claim stands out because it comes a year after North Carolinaenacted a lawrequiring sheriffs — who control local jails — to cooperate with federal immigration officials. They’re now required to inform ICE anytime someone is jailed on a suspicion of committing any crime other than a low-level misdemeanor. All felony allegations require ICE notification, as do allegations of misdemeanors related to impaired driving, domestic violence and other crimes. Historically, most sheriffs complied with ICE detainers. However, some sheriffs — including those in Wake and Mecklenburg counties, where Border Patrol is conducting operations — opposed the law for a number of reasons. Among them: a fear of violating someone’s constitutional rights. Those offices say they’re complying with the new law. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office is not blocking immigration officials from any of the 85 people in its jail who are suspected of being in the country illegally, office spokesperson Sarah Mastouri told PolitiFact. The Wake County Sheriff’s Office is also complying with detainer requests, office spokesperson Rosalia Fodera said. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 19, federal immigration officials took into custody 28 people who were in the Wake County jail, she said. The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, a group that represents and advocates for sheriffs across the state, said it was unaware of any sheriff who is out of compliance with the new law. ""I do not believe that there are any North Carolina sheriffs who are refusing to turn over inmates to ICE as required by law,"" association spokesperson Eddie Caldwell said. McLaughlin said, ""There’s about 1,400 criminal illegal aliens that, right now, are in North Carolina and Charlotte’s jails that they refuse to turn over to ICE law enforcement.""

West Virginia is “the only state losing population.”,Unknown,"By Trent Ao • November 21, 2025",false,1,"After Virginia saw sweeping Democratic victories in November’s elections, West Virginia state Sen. Sen. Chris Rose, a Republican, welcomed his neighboring state’s conservatives to move to his state, among the nation’s most solidly red. Another West Virginia legislator, Democratic Del. Kayla Young, responded to Rose onNov. 5. ""Wild to see the crashout of the GOP when their ideas are soundly rejected across the country,"" Young wrote. ""But come to WV, the only state losing population, where next session the focus will probably be forcing stupid AI memes to be coal-fired power generated too."" Wild to see the crashout of the GOP when their ideas are soundly rejected across the country.But come to WV, the only state losing population, where next session the focus will probably be forcing stupid AI memes to be coal-fired power generated too.https://t.co/cZdlWYHfK5 The part of Young’s post that caught our eye was the notion that West Virginia is ""the only state losing population."" That’s inaccurate. There are two ways to measure state population change. One is to compare the most recent population estimate, in this case for 2024, with the last full census, in 2020. The other is to compare the two most recent population estimates, which in this case would be from 2023 and 2024. West Virginia’s population fell by both measures. But it was not the only state with that outcome. Comparing the 2024 population estimate with the 2020 census, West Virginia saw the largest percentage decline in population among all 50 states — just over 1.2%. West Virginia was joined in population loss during that time period by six other states: California, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi and New York. The list of states losing population between the 2023 and 2024 estimates is smaller — only three. West Virginia is again on the list, though by this measurement its percentage loss was slightly smaller than Vermont’s. Mississippi also lost population during this period. When PolitiFact West Virginia reached out to Young, she acknowledged she should have clarified her point. ""I realize other states have lost population per census assumptions and numbers post the 2020 Census,"" she said, adding that West Virginia did have thesharpest declineof all 50 states after the 2020 census. West Virginia holds one other dubious population distinction. In 2021, when then-Gov. (now Sen.) Jim Justice said West Virginia ""is the only state to decline in population over the last 70 years,"" we rated thatTrue. West Virginia had about 2 million residents in the 1950 Census but only 1.79 million in the 2020 census and 1.77 million in the 2024 population estimate.

Young said West Virginia is ""the only state losing population."" Between the 2020 census and the 2024 population estimate, and between the 2023 and 2024 population estimates, West Virginia lost residents. But it was not the only state to do so.

"In Florida, “68 to 70% of property tax revenue” is from “second homes, investment properties, commercial properties, Airbnb,” not primary residences.",Unknown,"By Samantha Putterman • October 30, 2025",mostly-true,0,"As Florida’s Republican leaders consider overhauling the state’s property tax system, Gov. Ron DeSantis recently zeroed in on tax changes for primary homes, or homestead properties.During anOct.15 eventin West Palm Beach, a high school student asked DeSantis if there are alternative revenue sources that could replace property tax funding. Lawmakers have offeredcompeting proposals, but appear to be focused on changing how primary residences are taxed. DeSantis said governments could spend less money, and that primary residences are not local governments’ main source of property tax revenue.""The vast, vast majority of property tax revenue is not from homestead Floridians’ properties. It’s second homes, investment properties, commercial properties, Airbnb, all those other things,"" DeSantis said. ""That’s about 68 to 70% of property tax revenue statewide."" His estimate is very close.Sixty-four percent of Florida’s property tax revenue comes from properties that are not primary residences, preliminary 2025 data shows. ""It is reasonable to conclude that about two-thirds of the property taxes are paid by non-homesteaded properties,"" said Matt Caldwell, the Lee County property appraiser and a former Republican lawmaker. He said the statistic varies based on market changes.The idea of changing how Florida collects property taxes makes counties and cities nervous because no one has spelled out where the lost revenue would come from. ""Local governments will have to offset that revenue loss, meaning Floridians could see reductions in public services — things like first responders, emergency preparedness and disaster management — new or increased local taxes or fees, or a combination of these strategies,"" said Esteban Leonardo Santis, research director at the center-left Florida Policy Institute.PolitiFact contacted DeSantis’ office for comment but received no reply. Both theFlorida Policy Instituteand the Florida Legislature'sOffice of Economic and Demographic Researchreported in September that 36% of statewide property tax revenue comes from primary residences. Florida’s current homestead exemption is generous, and can reduce a home’s taxable value by as much as $50,000.The Florida Policy Instituteestimatedthat ending property taxes for these properties would cost about $18.5 billion, which breaks down to $7.8 billion for counties, $3 billion for cities and $7.7 billion for school districts. If the state fully or partially eliminates property tax on primary residences across all income levels, it could result in a cost shift, Santis said, and that could come in the form of a higher sales tax or corporate income tax.Florida renterswould not benefit from the policy.This kind of overhaul ""limits local fiscal autonomy, gives outsized benefits to owners of more expensive properties, and makes the state more susceptible to economic downturns,"" he said. Caldwell said part of the challenge is defining property tax. Some taxes are levied based on a property’s value, and others aren’t based on value, but both are included on tax bills. He said the distinction might not matter to the average property owner who will view property tax ""as everything charged to them"" on their November bill.Since August, DeSantis and Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia have traveled the state to talk about their efforts to root out what they describe as ""waste, fraud and abuse."" Floridians don’t need to pay property taxes, they say, when local governments are misusing millions.Butlocal governmentshave pushed backon those statements, saying some spending examples were misrepresented, approved by voters or weren’t funded by property taxes. DeSantis said in Florida, ""68 to 70% of property tax revenue"" is from ""second homes, investment properties, commercial properties, Airbnb,"" not primary residences. He’s very close. Sixty-four percent of Florida’s property tax revenue comes from properties that are not primary residences, including second homes, vacation rentals and businesses.Ending taxes for primary residences could cost about $18.5 billion across Florida counties, cities and school districts. That might result in reducing or privatizing services, or increasing the sales or corporate tax rates. DeSantis’ statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Cain asked Miller under what federal authority the Trump administration could arrest Pritzker if the governor tried to arrest ICE agents. ""To all ICE officers, you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties,"" Miller said. ""And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony.""

The day before Miller’s comments Pritzker signed anexecutive orderestablishing theIllinois Accountability Commissionto document federal law enforcement actions and refer possible law violations to local and state agencies for investigation.

Pritzker acknowledged in an Oct. 16interviewthat ""federal agents typically have federal immunity, but they’re not immune from the federal government holding them accountable and responsible."" His statement is less sweeping than Miller’s and Pritzker noted that the federal government can prosecute federal agents.

""The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,"" Blanche wrote. He cited several federal laws and provisions including the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause. The clause limits when states can prosecute federal agents who break state law, but it does not act as blanket immunity, legal experts said. Miller’s statement is ""wrong on its face,"" Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown University constitutional law professor,wrotein his Oct. 27 newsletter. Federal immigration agents can’t break the law with impunity. In 2024, a federal judgeconvictedandsentencedto federal prison a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent for using excessive force against two people at the southern border. Department of Homeland Security watchdog offices investigated the case. The federal government has cited its power to hold agents accountable in court arguments. After a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican boy at the southern border in 2010, the Justice Department said in a 2019Supreme Courtbrief that the federal government investigates allegations of excessive force by agents ""and may bring a federal criminal prosecution where appropriate."" Non-government organizations also can sue the federal government for its agents’ actions. Journalistssuedthe Trump administration saying federal agents are using ""a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians."" In that case, federal District Judge Sara Ellisorderedimmigration agents not to use tear gas and other riot control tactics unless people are posing an immediate threat. If the agents are going to use tear gas, they are required to give a verbal warning first. After reports that agents weren’t following the court order, EllisorderedGregory Bovino, the senior Border Patrol official overseeing the federal immigration actions in Chicago, to meet with her every weeknight to report all confrontations officers have with the public. (After this story published, a federal appeals courttemporarilypaused Ellis’ order.) Vladeck wrote that even if the Trump administration does not investigate or prosecute immigration agents who might have broken the law, it doesn’t mean the federal government doesn’t have the power to do so. Pritzkersaidhis state’s commission seeks to document actions that could be prosecuted in the future. State governments also can prosecute immigration agents if they break state law. However, there is a limitation known as supremacy clause immunity which comes from the U.S. Constitution’s clause that says federal law supersedes conflicting state laws. Protections against state prosecution for federal agents date back to an 1890 Supreme Courtdecision. David Neagle, a deputy U.S. marshal assigned to protect a Supreme Court justice, shot and killed a man who assaulted the justice. California arrested Neagle and charged him with murder. The Supreme Court ruled that the state couldn’t prosecute Neagle because he was carrying out official duties. Generally, federal agents are protected from state prosecution if their actions were authorized by federal law, and if the actions were ""necessary and proper"" for agents to fulfill their duties. A federal courtruledin 1990 that a customs agent was immune from state charges for speeding while driving during a drug operation. The agent acted under U.S. laws and was justified in concluding speeding was necessary to fulfill his duties, the court said. But a U.S. marine wasn’tgivenimmunity in 1990 after he killed a person in a car accident while he was driving in a military convoy in North Carolina. ""In short, while Supremacy Clause immunity grants federal officials a partial shield from state prosecution, that immunity is not absolute,"" Godar wrote. Contrary to Miller’s statement, Vladeck wrote, it’s not a felony ""for local or state authorities to arrest someone who they have probable cause to believe committed a state crime."" If a state brought charges against federal immigration agents, the court would have to determine whether an officer reasonably would have thought the actions were necessary to carry out federal duties. ""That’s a generous standard, to be sure,"" Vladeck wrote. ""But it is by no means a get-out-of-prosecution-free card."" Miller said, ""To all ICE officers, you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties."" Immigration agents, like other law enforcement officers, have broad protections when they’re conducting official duties. But they’re not immune from prosecution if they break state or federal law. The federal government can and does prosecute federal officers who break the law. States can’t prosecute agents for breaking state law if the agents were acting under the reasonable confines of their official duties. But those restrictions aren’t absolute. The statement contains an element of truth; federal immigration agents have some immunity from state prosecution. But the protections aren’t as sweeping as Miller made them sound, giving a different impression. Federal agents can and have been prosecuted by states. We rate Miller’s statement Mostly False.

"""Overall, the inflation since President Trump” took office “has come down.""",Unknown,"By Louis Jacobson • October 29, 2025",half-true,0,"President Donald Trump says he’s improved Americans’ lives when it comes to the economy and inflation, two areas thatpollsshow are top of mind for voters. ""Energy costs are way down,"" Trump told service members on the USS George Washington in Japan onOct. 28.""Gasoline prices are way down. Grocery prices are way down. We have a little problem with beef. We're gonna get that down very quickly. But the prices are way down. … Inflation has been defeated."" He also said at alunch in South Koreathe next day, ""We're down to a very low rate of inflation, 2.7%,"" calling it ""almost a perfect number."" It’s actually 3%. Two days earlier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also touted the administration’s progress on inflation. ""When we came in, it was ‘egg-flation, egg-flation, egg-flation,’"" Bessent said Oct. 26 on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" ""You know, egg prices are down. Gasoline prices are down. Overall, the inflation since President Trump has come in has come down."" On eggs and gasoline, Bessent has a point. Since December 2024, the month before Trump entered office, the price ofeggshas fallen. And since the week of Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, the price ofgasolinehas declined from $3.11 to $3.03 a gallon. (Trump was less accurate:Energy, especiallyelectricity, is up, as aregroceries. Trump was correct that prices of bothground beefandsteaksare up.) But it’s possible to find particular items with falling prices even as inflation as a whole rises. Is Bessent right that inflation ""has come down"" overall? It depends on what metric you use. The most basic overall measure of inflation is steady, or even up a little bit, depending on the time frame. But an inflation measure that excludes volatile food and energy costs is down slightly. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. We first turned to theconsumer price index, a widely tracked metric from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. While the federal government has paused calculating some key economic statistics during the ongoing shutdown, it still reported the consumer price index for September in order to produce an annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security. When economists study inflation, they typically look at the change in the consumer price index compared with one year earlier. Using this metric, inflation isn’t down under Trump. During Trump’s first three full months in office — February, March and April — the year-over-year inflation rate fell each month. It began rising in May, June, July and September. (Inflation remained steady in August, but it didn’t fall.) By September, the year-over-year inflation rate was 3% — right where it started in January (when Joe Biden turned over the presidency to Trump) and slightly higher than the 2.9% rate in December 2024, Biden’s last full month in office. The current 3% rate is higher than it was during the final six months of Biden's term. Either way, by this metric, inflation did not come down under Trump. The upward pattern of the most recent data points are worrisome, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. After 40-year-high levels of inflation in 2022 under Biden, the Federal Reserve ""had engineered a remarkably successful path to return to 2 percent, which has been disrupted by, especially, Trump’s tariffs,"" Holtz-Eakin said. ""Now, inflation is at 3 percent and rising. I expect it to keep rising."" To better grasp what’s going on with inflation, economists sometimes prefer to strip out the volatile sectors of food and energy. When those are removed from the analysis, Bessent has a point: Inflation has eased under Trump, at least modestly. The inflation rate minus food and energy was 3% year over year in September — lower than either December 2024 (3.2%) or January 2025 (3.3%). Price increases matter most to people when their wages aren’t keeping up. During virtually all of Biden’s term, wages failed to keep pace with inflation. Trump has a more positive story to tell so far: On his watch, wages are rising faster than prices, compared with their January levels. However, it’s still early in Trump’s tenure, cautioned the free-market oriented Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University. The comparative data on inflation and wages isn’t ""all that telling about where we might find ourselves in the coming months,""the center wroteSept. 22. ""The first seven months of a 48-month term in office is much too short to render judgement."" The center also said Trump’s tariff policies could reverse some of these trends. Bessent said, ""Overall, the inflation since President Trump has come in has come down."" Overall, year-over-year inflation has risen modestly to 3% on Trump’s watch, compared with 2.9% in Biden’s last full month in office. After stripping out volatile food and energy prices, which economists often do to analyze price patterns, the inflation rate has declined modestly under Trump, from 3.2% in Biden’s last full month in office to 3% now under Trump. Wages have outpaced inflation under Trump, although economists warn that his tariff policies could put that achievement at risk. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/oct/29/scott-bessent/overall-inflation-decline-trump/,PolitiFact.com (scraped on 2025-12-18)

"An ad from the government of Ontario, Canada, “misrepresents” President Ronald Reagan’s April 25, 1987, address about tariffs.",Unknown,"By Louis Jacobson • October 24, 2025",barely-true,0,"After the government of the Canadian province of Ontario released an anti-tariff ad taking aim at U.S. trade policy, President Donald Trump said the United States was cutting off trade negotiations with its northern neighbor. In an Oct. 23Truth Socialpost, Trump referenced astatementfrom The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. Trump wrote, ""The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs."" The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is anonprofitbased in Simi Valley, Calif., created by Reagan to advance his legacy and principles. The Reagan Foundation said the Canadian ad — which featured Reagan’sApril 25, 1987, radio address— used ""selective audio and video"" and ""misrepresents the Presidential Radio Address."" The one-minuteadincluded some of Reagan’s remarks out of chronological order. It also omitted that Reagan recorded the address after imposing duties on some Japanese products. A duty is a tax imposed on goods; a tariff is a type of duty imposed on imported or exported goods. However, the ad’s overall message doesn’t misrepresent Reagan’s views on tariffs. Reagan said he believed that in the long-term tariffs would lead to trade wars and hurt Americans. We asked the Reagan Foundation how the ad misrepresented Reagan’s address, but we did not receive a response by publication. When we asked the White House what was fake about the ad, spokesperson Kush Desai said, ""Even The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is calling out Ontario’s misleading and selective editing of President Reagan’s remarks."" Ontario Premier Doug FordsaidOct. 14 that a $75 million ad buy was planned and would air onmajor networks. On Oct. 24 — after Trump canceled trade talks with Canada — Fordsaidthe ad would continue to air during the first two World Series games but will pause after that, ""so that trade talks can resume."" Theadshows Reagan delivering the address. In the ad, he says: ""When someone says, ‘Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,’ it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And, sometimes for a short while, it works, but only for a short time. But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer. ""High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens: markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs. ""Throughout the world, there's a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition. America’s jobs and growth are at stake."" Some sentences in the ad are not in the same order as Reagan delivered them, but the reordering did not change his meaning.  (The sentence, ""But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer,"" was actually delivered earlier in Reagan’s remarks. The ad also edited in the word ""but."" Reagan said, ""And in a moment I'll mention the sound economic reasons for this: that over the long run such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer."") Reagan framed the action against Japan as an unusual case of leveraging trade policies to counteract specific behavior by one trading partner on one group of products. In another part of the address not quoted in the ad, Reagan said the actions involving ""Japanese semiconductors were a special case"" to ""deal with a particular problem, not begin a trade war."" Reagan also said, ""Now, imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take."" He said the result of a trade war would be ""more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying."" Like the address,Reagan’s overall trade recordoften supported free trade, but was at times nuanced. Reagan pushed for several international free-trade agreements, including the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which later incorporated Mexico and evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement. Reagan’s administration ""launched the most comprehensive set of global trade-barrier-reducing negotiations yet completed — the Uruguay Round, which eventually established the World Trade Organization,"" I.M. Destler, a University of Maryland public policy professor, told us in 2016; Destler died in 2025. That negotiation continued under President George H.W. Bush and was concluded and ratified, with large bipartisan margins, under President Bill Clinton. In a1985 address to business leaders, Reagan said, ""Our trade policy rests firmly on the foundation of free and open markets — free trade."" He also spoke about the merits and drawbacks of free trade. ""I believe that if trade is not fair for all, then trade is free in name only,"" he said. ""I will not stand by and watch American businesses fail because of unfair trading practices abroad. I will not stand by and watch American workers lose their jobs because other nations do not play by the rules."" Reagan sometimes bent to public pressure for more protectionist measures, as he did with Japanese semiconductors. In 1982, Reaganimposed quotason sugar, which resulted in higher prices. His administration negotiated more stringent provisions for textile and apparel imports, though not as tight as the industry wanted. And the administration set import quotas onmachine toolsfrom South Korea and imposedtariffs on Canadian lumber. His most significant protectionist trade moves were a pair of ""voluntary export restraints"" onsteeland oncars. These policies limited how many units foreign producers could ship to the United States, giving domestic producers some breathing room from foreign competition so they could retool their businesses. (The policies also raised prices for U.S. consumers and sometimes led to shortages.) The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said Ontario’s ad ""misrepresents"" Reagan’s 1987 address about tariffs. The ad edits together some sentences from a 1987 address, and it leaves out that in the address, Reagan said he would levy duties on some Japanese products. However, Reagan’s address framed the actions against Japan as exceptions to his general support of free trade, a position he championed not only in the parts quoted in the ad but also throughout much of the address.

As one wing of the iconic white structure was being turned to rubble nearby, reporters at anOct. 23 White House briefingquestioned Leavitt about the project. In the clip Democrats shared, Leavitt was responding to a question about Trump’s priorities on White House construction, not about all policies. Here’s the question that prompted Leavitt’s answer, and her response: Reporter: In addition to the ballroom and the Rose Garden patio, is the president looking at any other renovations or significant kinds of projects here at the White House? Leavitt: Not to my knowledge, no, but he's a builder at heart, clearly. And so, his heart and his mind is always churning about how to improve things here on the White House grounds. But at this moment in time, of course, the ballroom is really the president's main priority. We contacted Jeffries’ office and the Democratic Caucus on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24 and received no replies. As of publication, the X posts by Jeffries and the caucus remained on the X platform. When we contacted the White House, the press office referred us to anOct. 23  X postby an official White House account, Rapid Response 47. Thatpostreshared an Oct. 23Xpostby Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., that was similar to Jeffries’. The Rapid Response 47 account said Leavitt ""was answering a question specifically about construction projects on the White House grounds."" The Rapid Response 47 post also included the transcript of the question to Leavitt and her answer. Schumer’s post had reshared apostbyAcyn, an account that shares raw video on politics and is affiliated with the liberal MeidasTouch media company. The video shared by Acyn included the reporter’s full question and Leavitt’s full answer, but it summarized the exchange in a misleading manner, with a caption that read, ""Leavitt: At this moment in time, the ballroom is really the president's main priority."" Jeffries wrote, ""The Trump administration just declared that erecting a ballroom is the President’s main priority,"" rather than issues such as the cost of living and health care.

"“About 25% of the time the Coast Guard boards a ship, there are no drugs.”",Unknown,"By Samantha Putterman • October 22, 2025",mostly-true,0,"President Donald Trump says U.S. military strikes on eight vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, mostly targeting boats from Venezuela, were legal because they carried drugs being delivered to the United States.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said maritime law enforcement statistics show that not all boats suspected of carrying drugs actually have drugs onboard. He said the military’s strikes were not in line with usual U.S. policy.""When you stop people at sea in international waters, or in your own waters, you announce that you're going to board the ship and you're looking for contraband, smuggling or drugs. This happens every day off of Miami,"" Paul said Oct. 19 onNBC’s ""Meet the Press."" ""We know from Coast Guard statistics that about 25% of the time the Coast Guard boards a ship, there are no drugs. So if our policy now is to blow up every ship we suspect or accuse of drug running, that would be a bizarre world in which 25% of the people might be innocent."" Paul made a similar statement in anOct. 12 interview.More than 30 people have been killed so far in the strikes, and the Trump administration has provided no evidence that the vessels contained drugs. We rated Trump’s recent statement that each strike saved ""25,000 American lives""Pants on Fire.Paul’s office pointed PolitiFact to theU.S. Coast Guard’s 2024 fiscal year report, which said that year the agency intercepted drugs in about 73% of cases when they boarded boats, with about 27% of vessel interceptions yielding no drugs.Experts said the data supports Paul’s point, but noted that it’s unclear how the Coast Guard defines the term it uses to describe intercepting drugs — ""a drug disruption."" ""If the (Coast Guard) boards a vessel and finds a known drug trafficker but no drugs, and that individual gets arrested and convicted, does that count as a ‘drug disruption’?"" said Jonathan Caulkins, a Carnegie Mellon University drug policy researcher. ""Or suppose they approach the vessel, it jettisons the drugs overboard, and so the Coast Guard seizes the vessel but the drugs have disappeared into the water. Is that a successful disruption?"" Paul’s figure might not translate directly to the recent boat strikes, experts said, since the U.S. could have had intelligence about those specific vessels.PolitiFact contacted the Coast Guard about its data collection process but did not hear back. The Coast Guard reports data about how often it intercepts drugs to the Department of Homeland Security.Its 2024 fiscal year report, which covers October 2023 to September 2024, summarizes the agency’s performance in various programs.During that period of time, the Coast Guard disrupted drug runs in 91 out of 125 boat interdictions,the report says, which was a rate of about 73%.""The quality of searches performed by Coast Guard boarding teams is high,"" the report said, adding that its metrics depend on the quality and timeliness of the intelligence the agency receives.The rate has varied in recent years. The agency started reporting this drug interception data in fiscal year 2021,according to the report, which shows a drug disruption rate that year of 59% — meaning 41% of boats searched yielded no drugs.The rate rose to 64% in 2022 and 69% in 2023. The 2024 drug interception rate of 73% represents the Coast Guard’s highest since it started tracking the data. It lists an 80% interception rate as its annual  goal. The Coast Guard didn’t answer our questions about its data collection process or what amounts to a drug disruption. A2025 Coast Guard reportevaluating agency data from fiscal years 2021 through 2023 found it didn’t accurately reflect all drug interdictions as some reports didn’t contain drug seizure results or the required documentation.Experts said we don’t know whether the 2024 Coast Guard statistic directly translates to the recent strikes in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.""The people with fingers on the trigger may demand a much higher certainty rate before shooting,"" Caulkins said. ""So, even if the senator's figure were correct when looking across all the many, very diverse operations over the course of a year, that doesn't mean it applies to the special case of boats of Venezuela. Perhaps it does, but perhaps not.""The Trump administration’s lack of information about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats makes it impossible to know if every or any of the boats carried lethal drugs, and if they were en route to the U.S.Drug expertspreviously told usthat Venezuela plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S. Most illicit fentanyl in the U.S.comes from Mexico, not Venezuela. It enters the country mainly through the southern border at official ports of entry, and is smuggled inmostly by U.S. citizens. Paul said, ""About 25% of the time the Coast Guard boards a ship, there are no drugs."" A 2024 Coast Guard report said the agency boarded and intercepted boats with drugs on them about 73% of the time, which means 27% of the interceptions yielded no drugs.This drug disruption statistic, however, might not translate directly to the recent boat strikes, experts said, since we don’t know what kind of intelligence the U.S. had about those vessels.

"“Fifty percent of the presidents, almost, have used (the Insurrection Act). And that's unquestioned power.”",Unknown,"By Maria Ramirez Uribe • October 22, 2025",barely-true,0,"President Donald Trump says he still has options on the table for sending military into Chicago, where local leaders and courts have so far blocked his efforts to send the National Guard. ""Don't forget I can use the Insurrection Act. Fifty percent of the presidents, almost, have used that. And that's unquestioned power,"" Trump said during an Oct. 19 Fox Newsinterview. ""I choose not to."" Trump has said ifcourtsruleagainst his efforts to use ararely used statuteto deploy National Guard troops, he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act, a centuries-oldset of lawsthat allow the president to deploy federal military personnel domestically to suppress rebellion and enforce civilian law. Insurrection Act invocations aren’t as commonplace as Trump made them out to be. The act has been used on 30occasionsin U.S. history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Seventeen of the country’s 45 presidents, about 37%, have officially invoked it. The act hasn’t been used in more than 30 years. Trump is wrong to say the act gives him unquestioned power, legal experts said. Due process rights under the constitution remain in place and courts can rule on the invocation's legality even if they’ve been historically deferential to a president's use of the law. His statement also ignores critical context about the conditions under which the act has previously been invoked. The act ""has been used very rarely and almost exclusively in circumstances where there would be popular acknowledgement that there is an ongoing rebellion or some kind of ongoing civil conflict that is of a pretty profound nature,"" Bernadette Meyler, Stanford University law professor, said. Protests against immigration enforcement and crime aren’t ""the kind of trigger that ever has been used for invoking the Insurrection Act,"" she said. The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. Most of the Insurrection Act’s invocations took place more than 100 years ago. Former President Ulysses S. Grant invoked the law six times in the 1870s — the most of any president — as white supremacist groups violently revolted after the Civil War. (Trump has said one presidentused the law ""28 times,""without naming him. That’s inaccurate.) From 1962 to 1963, former President John F. Kennedy used the Insurrection Act three times to combat local governments that were forcibly opposing school desegregation following the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision.  In this Oct. 15, 1957, file photo, seven of nine black students walk onto the campus of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., with a National Guard officer as an escort as other troops watch. (AP) These cases represent a ""defiance of federal law by state governments,"" Tung Yin, professor of law at Lewis & Clark Law School, told PolitiFact. ""It's not Portland police out there that are obstructing ICE or Oregon troops being deployed by Oregon Gov. (Tina) Kotek to interfere with ICE,"" Yin said. ""So I think that just makes the context look different.""  The most recent invocation came in 1992, when then-California Gov. Pete Wilson requested military support from President George H.W. Bush afterriotsbroke out following the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. This is an example of a case ""where local and state officials are completely and totally overwhelmed by the scale and scope of violence,"" Christopher Mirasola, University of Houston Law Center assistant professor, said. This level of mayhem is not in cities Trump has targeted for National Guard deployment, such as Portland and Chicago, where private citizens are protesting against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  Two National guardsmen stand guard outside a burning donut shop at Martin Luther King Boulevard and Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles April 30, 1992. The National Guard was called in to aid police during the second day of rioting in the city. (AP) Trump also has made inaccurate claims about the scope of his authority when the Insurrection Act is in effect. It doesn’t give the president ""unquestioned power,"" as Trump said. ""Presidents do not have unquestioned authority. They have limited authority that is available to them in very extraordinary circumstances, when there's an insurrection,"" Chris Edelson, an American University assistant professor of government, said. Even during the Insurrection Act, people’s constitutional due process rights are protected, Mirasola said. Due process generallyrefersto the government's requirement to follow fair procedures and laws. Trump also exaggerated Oct. 19when he told reportersthere are ""no more court cases"" when the act is invoked. Courts can rule on whether the use of the Insurrection Act is legal, Meyler said. However, the act is broadly written and doesn’t define terms such as ""insurrection"" or ""rebellion."" The U.S. Supreme Courtruledin 1827 that the president has exclusive power to decide whether a situation represents an acceptable reason to invoke the law. Trump said, ""Fifty percent of the presidents, almost, have used"" the Insurrection Act, ""and that's unquestioned power."" The act has been used by 17, or 37%, of U.S. presidents. Most of those 30 invocations took place more than 100 years ago, so it’s not as frequent as Trump made it seem. Legal experts said Trump’s focus on the numbers omits context about his proposed use of the act to stop protesting and crime. The act has been invoked to stop rebellions, white supremacist revolts and force state governments to follow federal laws regarding desegregation. The last president to use the act, Bush in 1992, did so in California at the request of the governor after riots broke out in Los Angeles. He’s also wrong to say the law gives him ""unquestioned power."" Due process rights under the constitution remain in place and courts can rule on the invocation's legality, even if they’ve been historically deferential to a president's use of the act. His statement ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"""Political violence, it's just a statistical fact that it's a bigger problem on the left.”",Unknown,"By Amy Sherman • October 20, 2025",barely-true,0,"Following the September assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have shaped their political agenda by blaming the left for political violence. ""Political violence, it's just a statistical fact that it's a bigger problem on the left,"" Vancesaidwhileguest-hostingThe Charlie Kirk Show podcast Oct. 15 in the aftermath of Kirk’s killing. About a minute later, he added, ""Right now that violent impulse is a bigger problem on the left than the right."" A Vance spokesperson did not answer our questions. When referring to left-wing violence, a White House spokesperson recentlypointed toa Sept. 28Axios articleabout a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonprofit policy research organization. The study found that ""2025 marks the first time in more than 30 years that left-wing terrorist attacks outnumber those from the violent far right."" The study also showed that for the 30 years before 2025, right-wing attacks had outpaced left-wing attacks. ""The rise in left-wing attacks merits increased attention, but the fall in right-wing attacks is probably temporary, and it too requires a government response,"" the study’s authors wrote. Vance’s statement oversimplified political violence and drew from part of one study of a six-month period. The federal government has no single, official definition of ""political violence"" and ascribing ideologies such as left-wing and right-wing is sometimes complicated. There is no agreed upon number of left- or right-wing politically violent attacks. Research before 2025largely pointsto higher levels of right-wing violence over longer periods of time. Trump has used the administration’s statements about rising left-wing violence to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, and administration officials alsosaidthey willinvestigatewhat they call left-wing groups that fund violence. Although political violence is a small subset of violent crime in the U.S., it ""has a disproportionate impact because even rare incidents can amplify fear, influence policy and deepen societal polarization,"" University of Dayton sociology professors Arthur Jipson and Paul J. Beckerwrotein September after Kirk’s assassination. In an email interview with PolitiFact, Becker said the report in question, ""indicates there MAY be a shift occurring from the Right being more violent but 5 vs. 1 incidents in 6 months isn't enough to completely erase years of data and reports from multiple sources showing the opposite or to dictate new policies."" The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a national security and defense think tank, published a Septemberreportexamining 750 terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. between 1994 and July 4, 2025. The report defined terrorism as the use or threat of violence ""with the intent to achieve political goals by creating a broad psychological impact."" The authors wrote that it is difficult to pinpoint some perpetrators’ ideologies, which in some cases are more of what former FBI director Christopher Wray called a ""salad bar of ideologies."" For example, Thomas Crooks, who attempted to assassinate Trump in 2024, searched the internet more than 60 times for Trump and then-President Joe Biden in the month before the attack. The full CSIS report gave a more complete picture of politically motivated violence: Left-wing violence has risen from low levels since 2016. ""It has risen from very low levels and remains much lower than historical levels of violence carried out by right-wing and jihadist attackers."" Right-wing attacks sharply declined in 2025, perhaps because right-wing extremist grievances such as opposition to abortion, hostility to immigration and suspicion of government agencies are ""embraced by President Trump and his administration."" The report quotes Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader pardoned by Trump, whosaid, ""Honestly, what do we have to complain about these days?"" Left-wing attacks have been less deadly than right-wing attacks. In the past decade, left-wing attacks have killed 13 victims, compared with 112 for right-wing attackers. The report cited several reasons, including that left-wing attackers often choose targets that are protected such as government or law enforcement facilities, and target specific individuals. The number of incidents by the left is small. A graphic in the report showing the rise in left-wing attacks in 2025 as of July 4 is visually striking. It is based on a small number of incidents: four attacks and one disrupted plot. Studies have not uniformly agreed on some attackers’ ideological classifications. The libertarian Cato Institute categorized the person charged in the shooting deaths of two Israeli embassy staffers in May 2025 as left-wing, while the CSIS study described the motivation as ""ethnonationalist."" (Ethnonationalismis a political ideology based on heritage, such as ethnic identity, which can create clashes with other groups.) The Cato study counted only deaths while the CSIS analysis was not limited to deaths. ""While Vance’s statement has a factual anchor for that limited timespan, it selectively emphasizes one short-term slice rather than the broader trend,"" Jipson, of the University of Dayton, told PolitiFact. ""In that sense, it can be misleading: It may give the impression that left-wing violence is generally now more dangerous or prevalent, which is not borne out by the longer view of the data."" A photo of Trump is seen at a growing memorial for Charlie Kirk outside Timpanogos Regional Hospital after Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10, 2025, in Orem, Utah. (AP) The Cato analysis, published after Kirk’s death, said 3,597 people were killed in politically motivated U.S. terrorist attacks from Jan. 1, 1975, through Sept. 10, 2025. Cato found right-wing attacks were more common than left-wing. This research has been highlighted by some HouseDemocrats. Catowrotethat during that time period, terrorists inspired by Islamist ideology were responsible for 87% of people killed in attacks on U.S. soil, while right-wing attackers accounted for 11% and left-wing terrorists accounted for about 2%. Excluding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks showed right-wing attackers were responsible for a majority of deaths. Measuring homicides since 2020 also showed a larger number by the right than the left. Vance said, ""Political violence, it's just a statistical fact that it's a bigger problem on the left."" Vance did not point to a source, but a White House spokesperson separately cited an article about a study that examined political violence from 1994 to July 4, 2025. It found in the first six months of 2025, left-wing terrorist attacks outnumbered those by the right. It is based on a small number of incidents: four attacks and one disrupted plot. The study also showed that for 30 years before 2025, right-wing attacks had outpaced left-wing attacks. The study detailed that left-wing ""remains much lower than historical levels of violence carried out by right-wing and jihadist attackers."" Research before 2025 largely points to higher levels of right-wing violence over longer periods of time. The statement contains an element of truth because left-wing violence rose in the first six months of 2025. However, it ignores that right-wing violence was higher for a much longer period of time.

“Portland is burning to the ground.”,Unknown,"By Maria Briceño • October 7, 2025",false,1,"President Donald Trump, who is seeking to send the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, said the city is in flames. ""Portland is burning to the ground, it’s insurrectionists all over the place,"" Trumptold reportersOct. 5 before heading to a celebration of the U.S. Navy, echoing hisprevious statements. ""It’s antifa …Portland is burning to the ground."" ""All you have to do is look at the television, turn on your television, read your newspapers,"" Trump said. Trump’s descriptions of the city as inflamed orwar ravagedamid Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests prompted a tide of social media sarcasm about Portlanders wearingchicken costumes,waving their hands in unisonto outdoor music or revoltingagainst a fictional flannel shortage. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut, a 2019 Trumpnominee, on Oct. 4 temporarilyblockedthe administration from deploying the Oregon National Guard. The Trump administration then sought to deploy the California National Guard, and the judge Oct. 5blockedthe administration from deploying federalized members of the guard. The Trump administration is appealing, saying it wants to deploy the guard to protect federal ICE officers and a facility at the center of protests. Although dozens of people have been arrested and charged with crimes near the ICE facility since June, it’s not accurate that the city is ""burning."" This isn’t the first time Trump hasexaggerated Portland’s protests. In August 2020, amid larger protests over George Floyd’s killing, Trump said, ""The entire city (of Portland) is ablaze all the time."" By our count, there were 54 fires set across 95 nights of demonstrations, which largely took place at one of 10 locations. This time around, there are fewer fires. A protester stomps on a burning U.S. flag during a protest near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Oregon, Oct. 6, 2025. (AP) We examined recent TV, newspaper and social media reports about Portland. The evidence shows that much of the city was functioning normally. U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,sharedvideo clipsshowing people running or walking in the Portland marathon. Some spectatorsheld colorful hand drawn signsprotesting ICE. TheKing Farmers Market, which has been held Sundays since May, showedphotos and videosfrom Oct. 5 of vendors selling cider, mushrooms and cold brew, and adults and children painting their own pumpkins. ThePortland Film Festivalran as scheduled from Oct. 1 to 5. The story was similar in summer, when ICE facility protests picked up. In June, Portlanders haddifferent eventssuch as thePDX Beer Week, theJuneteenth Oregon Parade and Festival, and thePortland Rose Festival, with its parades, fireworks and boat races. On July 26, the Portland Naked Bike Ridesaidit drew 5,700 cyclists who protested oil dependency, cyclist vulnerability and for body freedom. The Portland World Naked Bike Ride’s Instagram account posted footage of bikers in underwear and naked biking around the city. The naked rides have been common in Portlandsince 2004as a statement on cyclists’ rights and a way of protesting pollution. People protest outside of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Oregon, Oct. 3, 2025. (AP) Most of the tension since June has centered outside of an ICE facility in south Portland. The protesters have set small fires, according tonews reports,police and court records. In itsappealof the order blocking National Guard deployments, the Trump administration said there were a handful of incidents in which protesters set fire, including on June 11 when Portland policesaida man stacked flammable material against the ICE building and another man placed a lit flare, starting a fire.Federal officersquickly extinguished the fire. During the arrest, one suspect punched and tried to choke a police officer. Oregon’sKPTVreported in June that protesters set a fire near the ICE building, leading to 10 arrests, including four for arson. The appeal said that protesters on June 14 launched fireworks at officers, resulting in two fires that federal officers extinguished.Portland policedeclared a riot and arrested three people. The appeal mentioned the threat of fires from other incidents that could have led to damage such as flag burning, pouring motor oil or lighting an incendiary device. PolitiFact found no recent reports about arrests for arson, as of Oct. 6. Rick Graves, Portland Fire and Rescue spokesperson, said firefighters were dispatched four times to the ICE facility between June 6 and Sept. 30. (A small fire that is quickly suppressed may not be recorded by fire rescue.) ""These were reports of two flags burning, a smoke grenade tossed by ICE agents that ended up beneath a vehicle that confused the caller into thinking a vehicle fire had occurred, and the fourth call was as a result of someone watching a TikTok video and calling 911 thinking what they were seeing was live,"" Graves said. Graves told PolitiFact, ""There have not been any significant fires to structures that led to any investigations or arrests as these have not hit my desk or been within my orbit."" From June 6 to Sept. 30, building fires citywide declined by one-third compared with the same timeframe last year, he said. In a prominent incident that happened miles away from the ICE facility and is unrelated to the protests, rapper Ice Cube’s tour bus caught fire Sept. 23 after the front wheel of the bus caught fire, according tonewsreports. Portland police called the fire, which started with the front wheel, a random act of vandalism. Law enforcement agencies have arrested dozens of protesters outside the ICE facility in recent months. In anop-ed for The Oregonian, Portland Police Chief Bob Day wrote that one city block out of Portland’s 145 square miles has ""drawn outsized attention in news cycles. Viral clips — sometimes months or years old — paint a picture that is not consistent with the Portland we see every day."" AFP Fact Checkfound that social media accounts have shared images during the past week of Portland as if they were recent, but they are actually from the 2020 protests following Floyd’s murder. In since-deleted social media posts about Portland, the Oregon Republican Party shared a combination of two photos of scenes that happened in South America nearly a decade apart,The Guardian reported. Fox Newsaired a Sept. 4 storythat mixed footage of the 2025 protests with videos from Portland’s 2020 protests, including people setting fire to the base of a downtown statue and federal officers using chemical spray on a person. Fox later added an editor’s noteaddressing the old footage. The next day, Trumpdescribed""the destruction of the city"" and floated the idea of sending law enforcement. When we contacted the White House for this fact-check, spokesperson Abigail Jackson sent us a statement that ""this summer, rioters in Portland have been charged for crimes including arson and assaulting police officers."" The White House pointed tonewsarticlessince June about arrests and violence in Portland. Generally fewer than 100 people — and ""consistently not more than two-dozen"" – have gathered nightly outside the ICE facility, with limited need for police intervention, Craig Dobson, the city’s assistant chief of operations,wrotein a Sept. 29 court document. The nightly protests since mid July ""have been largely sedate,"" Dobson wrote, and ""bear no resemblance to the sustained, large protests of 2020."" Since the protests began in June, there have been about 60 arrests; the police departmentreported36 and the U.S. Attorney’s Officesaidit had charged 28 defendants. TheOregonianreported Oct. 4 that in 2025, most nights the protesters have numbered in the few dozens ""largely been confined to a two-block radius of the building’s front driveway."" On Oct. 3, there were around eight to 15 people mostly sitting in lawn chairs and walking around, police said, according toOregon Public Broadcasting. The newspaperreportedthat Trump’s announcement about wanting to send the National Guard spurred bigger crowds and more unlawful behavior. Trump said, ""Portland is burning to the ground."" Since protests outside of the ICE facility began in June, city and federal officials have arrested about 60 defendants, including at least a few for arson. That does not show an entire city ""burning to the ground."" These criminal actions are confined to a block or two out of the city’s 145 square miles. Normal life has continued throughout much of the city in recent months as residents have participated in events such as a marathon, the farmer’s market, a film festival and a naked bike ride.

“Los demócratas están amenazando con cerrar todo el gobierno porque quieren dar cientos de miles de millones de dólares en beneficios de cuidado de salud a los inmigrantes ilegales”.,Unknown,"By Maria Ramirez Uribe • October 2, 2025",false,1,"Los republicanos han acusado varias veces a los demócratas de cerrar el gobierno por querer dar acceso a seguros médicos subsidiados por el gobierno federal a inmigrantes ilegalmente en EE.UU. ""Los demócratas están amenazando con cerrar todo el gobierno porque quieren dar cientos de miles de millones de dólares en beneficios de cuidado de salud a los inmigrantes ilegales"",dijoel vicepresidente JD Vance el 28 de septiembre en ""Fox News Sunday"". El presidenteDonald Trump, el presidente de la Cámara de Representantes, Mike Johnson, y los miembros republicanos del Congreso han repetido esta afirmación. No es correcta. Los demócratas se negaron a votar por la resolución republicana para extender el plazo de financiación federal, y su postura se basa, en parte, en el financiamiento de programas de salud. Los demócratas buscan prorrogar los subsidios bajo la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible (ACA, por sus siglas en inglés, también conocida como Obamacare), creados durante la pandemia, que expiran a fin de año. También quieren revertir los recortes de Medicaid en la ley fiscal y de gastos que Trump firmó este verano. Lapropuesta demócratano otorga seguros médicos a inmigrantes ilegalmente en EE.UU. — quienes, en gran medida, no son elegibles para recibir atención médica financiada por el gobierno federal. Por el contrario, la propuesta restablecería la elegibilidad a ciertos programas de salud para los inmigrantes con estatus legal, quienes perderían el acceso bajo la ley republicana. La Casa Blanca no respondió a la solicitud de comentario de PolitiFact para esta verificación. Vancerespondió a las críticasa su afirmación en otra entrevista, diciendo que estaba incluida en la propuesta de gasto de los demócratas; pero no lo está. Unacuentaen X de la Casa Blanca publicó capturas de pantalla de la propuesta demócrata que revoca una sección de la ley republicana sobre ""la elegibilidad de Medicaid"" para extranjeros. Es importante saber que estos cambios no otorgarían acceso a Medicaid a los inmigrantes ilegalmente en EE.UU. Vance volvió a defender su afirmación en unaconferencia de prensaen la Casa Blanca el 1 de octubre, diciendo que el expresidente Joe Biden ""usó su varita mágica de amnistía para darle a millones de personas estatus legal"" permitiéndoles acceder a la asistencia federal. Hay que aclarar que muchas de las personas conestatus legala través del parole humanitario o el Estatus de Protección Temporal (TPS, por sus siglas en inglés), no son automáticamente elegibles para Medicaid; los beneficiarios del TPS no sonelegibles, y muchos con parole humanitario deben esperar cinco años para acceder a él. La administración Trump terminó con el parole humanitario y el Estatus de Protección Temporal para muchas personas, lo que las hizo inelegibles para Medicaid y el mercado de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible. No encontramos evidencia de que los demócratas quieran gastar ""cientos de miles de millones de dólares"" en la cobertura de salud para migrantes con presencia ilegal. La gran mayoría de los fondos federales para el sistema de salud no pueden gastarse en atención médica para personas ilegalmente en EE.UU. Ellos no pueden inscribirse en Medicaid ni en Medicare y soninelegiblespara comprar un seguro médico a través del mercado de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible. Un pequeño programa de Medicaid reembolsa a los hospitales por la atención de emergencia que se les da a personas sin seguro, la cual puede incluir a inmigrantes ilegalmente en el país, pero no es un programa exclusivo para ellos. Algunosestados, incluyendo California e Illinois, ampliaron la cobertura de Medicaid para personas sin importar su estatus migratorio. Los estados financian estos programas ya que la ley federal prohíbe el uso de fondos federales para aquellos. Unaversión anteriorde la ley de gasto republicana habría penalizado a estos estados reteniendo fondos, pero esa cláusula fue eliminada. Las personas ilegalmente en el país pueden recibir cierta atención médica financiada por el gobierno en casos de emergencia. En estos casos, los hospitales deben brindar atención, incluso si la persona no tiene seguro o está ilegalmente en el país. El programa de Medicaid de emergencia cubre la atención hospitalaria para inmigrantes que serían elegibles para Medicaid si no fuera por su estatus migratorio. La ley de impuestos y gastos republicanaredujola cantidad de dinero que pueden recibir los hospitales por la atención de emergencia a inmigrantes. La mayor parte de los gastos de Medicaid de emergencia se utilizan para reembolsar servicios de parto. En total, los reembolsos del Medicaid de emergencia representaron menos del 1% de los gastos totales de Medicaid en el año fiscal 2023, segúnKFF, un centro de investigación de estudios de políticas de salud.  La ley fiscal y de gastos republicana modificó la elegibilidad para la asistencia médica de los inmigrantes con permiso legal. Se estima que 1.4 millones de inmigrantes legales perderán su seguro médico, según unanálisisde KFF de las proyecciones de laOficina de Asuntos Presupuestarios del Congreso de EE.UU. A partir de octubre de 2026, la ley restringirá la elegibilidad para Medicaid y el Programa de Seguro Médico para Niños (CHIP, por sus siglas en inglés), a residentes permanentes legales, personas de las Islas Marshall, Micronesia o Palau que residen legalmente en EE.UU. bajo unacuerdo internacional, y ciertoscubanos y haitianos. Anteriormente, un grupo más amplio, denominado""no ciudadanos calificados"", era elegible para Medicaid y CHIP, incluyendo refugiados y personas con asilo. Algunos inmigrantes elegibles para Medicaid y CHIP, como los residentes permanentes legales,deben esperar cinco añospara acceder a estos programas. La ley también limitó la elegibilidad para el mercado de seguros de salud de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible al mismo grupo que es elegible para Medicaid y CHIP a partir del 1 de enero de 2027. Anteriormente, eran elegibles las personas consideradas ""presentes legalmente"". Este grupo incluía a los ""no ciudadanos calificados"" elegibles para Medicaid y a ciertas personas con estatus migratorio temporal, como los beneficiarios del Estatus de Protección Temporal o los estudiantes internacionales. Los beneficiarios del programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA, por sus siglas en inglés), para inmigrantes que ingresaron ilegalmente a EE.UU. durante la infancia, eran elegibles para la cobertura de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible y sus subsidios. Sin embargo, unamedidade Trump en agosto los excluyó.  Una agente de seguros conversa con clientes en la sucursal principal de ""Las Madrinas de los Seguros"", ubicada en un centro comercial de Miami, el 5 de diciembre de 2023. (AP) Lapropuestade presupuesto de los demócratas del 17 de septiembre, entre otras cosas,extendería permanentementelos subsidios de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible y revertiría miles de millones de dólares en recortes republicanos a Medicaid y otros programas de salud. Este cambio haría que la cobertura de Medicaid, CHIP y la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible estuviera disponible para todos los inmigrantes con estatus legal que antes eran elegibles, como los refugiados y las personas con asilo. La propuesta demócrata no ampliaría la elegibilidad a los programas de salud financiados federalmente para los inmigrantes ilegalmente en EE.UU. Vance dijo que las políticas demócratas le darían ""cientos de miles de millones de dólares en beneficios de cuidado de salud a los inmigrantes ilegales"", y la Casa Blanca no especificó la fuente de esa cifra. Cuando sepresionóa Johnson para que respaldara una afirmación similar, él hizo referencia a la Oficina de Asuntos Presupuestarios del Congreso, (CBO, por sus siglas en inglés). Unanálisisde KFF en agosto, basado enestimacionesde la CBO, determinó que las clausulas o articulos de la ley republicana relativas a los inmigrantes con estatus legal reducirían el gasto federal en $131 mil millones de dólares; esta proyección no incluyó una estimación para las personas sin estatus legal. Vance dijo, ""Los demócratas están amenazando con cerrar todo el gobierno porque quieren dar cientos de miles de millones de dólares en beneficios de cuidado de salud a los inmigrantes ilegales"". Los inmigrantes ilegalmente en EE.UU. no son elegibles para los programas de salud financiados federalmente, como Medicare y Medicaid, ni pueden obtener cobertura a través del mercado de seguros de salud de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible ni solicitar subsidios. La propuesta de presupuesto de los demócratas no cambiaría esto. Los demócratas quieren restablecer el acceso a ciertos programas de salud para los inmigrantes con estatus legal que perderán ese acceso debido a la ley fiscal y de gasto republicana — entre otras medidas para facilitar a las personas mantener sus planes de seguro de Medicaid y la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible. Su propuesta no otorgaría beneficios de salud financiados por el gobierno federal a las personas que se encuentran ilegalmente en EE.UU., ya que, esas personas no han sido elegibles anteriormente. La pequeña cantidad de fondos destinados al programa Medicaid de Emergencia reembolsa a los hospitales que prestan atención médica de urgencia a inmigrantes que serían elegibles para Medicaid si no fuera por su situación migratoria.

"Thirty percent of U.S. medical residents are international medical graduates, and 10,000 of 43,000 residency spots are filled by H-1B visa holders.",Unknown,"By Maria Briceño • October 2, 2025",half-true,0,"President Donald Trump announced that H-1B visa fees would increase to $100,000, a move that some social media users said could worsen U.S. physician shortages. As of Sept. 21, new H-1B visa applicationswill requirea $100,000 fee, up from $2,000 to $5,000. The Trump administrationsaidthe fee is to prevent American workers from ""being replaced with lower-paid foreign labor."" The H-1B visa program lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialty fields. Several medical associations sent a Sept. 25letterto Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, asking for physicians and other medical personnel to be exempted from the new H-1B visa fee, because of a critical need for doctors  as the U.S. population grows. While policy experts said the proclamation allows for  exempting certain industries from the fee, the Trump administration hasn’t announced any exceptions yet. A doctor who also hosts a podcastposted data on Xthat he said showed how many medical residency spots are filled by H-1B visa holders. ""This will be absolutely devastating in the medical field. ~30% residents are international medical graduates & ~10k of 43k residency spots are filled by docs with H-1B visas,"" theSept. 19 postsaid. ""Previously the h-1B fee was <$5,000. No hospital will pay a $100k fee for a $55k resident salary."" Residency is thephaseof physician training when recent medical school graduates participate in supervised clinical training in a healthcare facility. The X post is partially accurate but leaves out important details about international students and medical residents in the U.S. The X post cited as evidence a 2025 National Resident Matching Programreportthat says approximately 30% of U.S. medical residents are international medical graduates. It’s important to note, though, that this category includes foreign graduates and U.S. citizens who graduated from international schools. The report says that of international medical graduates who obtained a spot in first-year U.S. residency programs, 3,108 were U.S. citizens and 6,653 were noncitizens. It’s inaccurate that 10,000 of 43,000 resident spots are filled by H-1B visa holders. The X post cites a2017 reportthat analyzed2016 Labor Department data. This data shows how many working U.S. physicians were certified for H-1B visas. It includes all doctors, not only those in residency. (More recent Labor Department data from the last quarter of 2025, covering determinations from Oct. 1, 2024, through June 30, shows that around 9,000 physicians were certified for H-1B visas.) TheAmerican Medical Association saysthe most common visa used by medical graduates for medical residency is the J-1 visa, which is forgraduate medical educationor training, among other purposes. The majority of H1-B visa workers have been hired in STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — occupations, with about two-thirds working in computer-related fields, according to theCongressional Research Service. Nancy Nielsen, University at Buffalo senior associate dean for health policy, also confirmed to PolitiFact that the most common visa used for medical residency is the J-1 visa. She said for context, in her school, they have about 830 medical residents and only 27 are on H-1B visas. PolitiFact reached out to the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a division ofIntealth, which helps medical graduates with sponsorship obtain training in the U.S., and the commission said to its knowledge, no centralized data repository exists for H-1B physicians in residency. The H-1B visa is available to graduates of foreign medical schools who have a license or other authorization required by the state where they’ll practice, and people who have an unrestricted license to practice medicine or have graduated from a U.S. medical school,accordingto the American Medical Association. Prospective H-1B employers must attest that they will pay the H-1B worker the greater of the actual wage paid to similar employees or the prevailing wages for that occupation. The visa status is generally valid for up to three years and renewable for another three years, but can be extended if the employer sponsors the worker for permanent residency. Congresscapsthe number of new H-1B visas at 85,000 per fiscal year, including 20,000 for noncitizens who earned a U.S. master’s degree or higher. The fiscal year 2025 cap wasmetin December 2024. Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank, told PolitiFact that the H-1B visa fee must be paid by the employer, not the employee. ""The H-1B employees are generally not allowed to pay for the primary fees for visas and processing, they are the responsibility of the employer,"" Costa said via email Sept. 24. An X user said that 30% of medical residents are international medical graduates and 10,000 of 43,000 medical residency spots are filled by doctors with H-1B visas. Data shows that approximately 30% of medical residents are international medical graduates, which includes both U.S. citizens and noncitizens. Ten thousand doctors hold H-1B visas, but that represents all physicians, not only those in residency. TheAmerican Medical Association saysthe most common visa used by medical graduates for medical residency is the J-1 visa. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

“Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens.”,Unknown,"By Maria Ramirez Uribe • October 1, 2025",false,1,"As the U.S. headed for a government shutdown, Republicans repeatedly accused Democrats of forcing the closure because they want to give health care access to immigrants in the U.S. illegally. ""Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of healthcare benefits to illegal aliens,"" Vice President JD VancesaidSept. 28 on ""Fox News Sunday."" PresidentDonald Trump,House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican members of Congress have repeated this line. It’s wrong. Democrats have refused to vote for Republicans’ resolution to extend the federal spending deadline, and their position does, in part, hinge on health care spending. Democrats want to extend pandemic-era Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and roll back Medicaid cuts in the tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law this summer. TheDemocrats' proposalwouldn’t give health care to immigrants illegally in the U.S. — they are already largely ineligible for federally funded health care. Instead, the proposal would restore access to certain health care programs for legal immigrants who will lose access under the Republican law. The White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment for this fact-check. Vanceaddressed criticismof his talking point in another interview by saying it was included in the Democrats’ spending proposal; it’s not. A White House Xaccountfollowed up with screenshots of the Democratic proposal repealing a section of the Republican law labeled ""alien Medicaid eligibility."" It’s important to know that these changes would not give Medicaid access to immigrants illegally in the U.S.  IMAGE 1: Straight from Democrat proposalIMAGE 2: OBBB Table of Contents (Title VII, Subsection B repealed in Democrat proposal)IMAGE 3: Actual text of OBBB section ending health care for illegals (repealed in Democrat proposal)https://t.co/cThGVkgwSfpic.twitter.com/xeLXQeL0VU Vance defended his statement again in an Oct. 1 White Housepress conference, saying former President Joe Biden ""waived away illegal immigration status"" that helped migrants access federal assistance. It’s important to note that many peoplegranted lawful statusthrough humanitarian parole or Temporary Protected Status programs don’t automatically qualify for Medicaid; TPS  recipients aren’teligible, and many people who entered the U.S. on humanitarian parole are required to wait five years before accessing it. The Trump administration has ended humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status for many people, rendering them ineligible for Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace. We did not find evidence that Democrats want to spend ""hundreds of billions"" in costs for insuring migrants with unlawful presence. The vast majority of federal health care dollars cannot be spent on health care for people in the U.S. illegally. They cannot enroll in Medicaid or Medicare, and they areineligibleto purchase health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. A small Medicaid program reimburses hospitals for uninsured emergency care, which can include immigrants in the country illegally but is not exclusive to them. Somestatesincluding California and Illinois expanded Medicaid coverage for people regardless of their immigration status, and the states pay for that. Federal law already banned states from using federal money for these programs. Anearlier versionof the Republican spending law would have penalized such states by withholding funding, but that provision didn’t last. People in the country illegally might receive some federally funded health care in emergency cases; in those situations, hospitals must provide care even if a person is uninsured or in the country illegally. Emergency Medicaid covers hospital care for immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. The Republican tax and spending lawreducedthe amount hospitals can receive for emergency immigrant care. Most of the Emergency Medicaid spending is used on childbirth. In all, it represented less than 1% of total Medicaid spending in fiscal year 2023, according toKFF, a health think tank. The Republican tax and spending law made several changes to health care eligibility for immigrants in the country with legal permission. An estimated 1.4 million legal immigrants are expected to lose their health insurance, according to KFF’sanalysisofCongressional Budget Officeprojections. Starting October 2026, the law will restrict eligibility for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program to lawfully permanent residents, people from the Marshall Islands, Micronesia or Palau who lawfully reside in the U.S. under aninternational agreement, and certainCubans and Haitians. Previously, a broad group described as ""qualified noncitizens"" were eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, including refugees and people granted asylum. Some immigrants who are eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, such as lawful permanent residents, arerequired to wait five yearsbefore accessing the benefits. The law also limited Affordable Care Act marketplace eligibility to the same group eligible for Medicaid and CHIP beginning Jan. 1, 2027. Previously, people who were described as ""lawfully present"" were eligible. That group included the ""qualified noncitizens"" eligible for Medicaid and people with short-term statuses, such as Temporary Protected Status or international students. Beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, for immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children were previously eligible for Affordable Care Act coverage and its subsidies. They are ineligible after an August Trump administrationrule. The Democrats’ Sept. 17 budgetproposalwould, in part,permanently extendthe Affordable Care Act subsidies and roll back billions in Republican cuts to Medicaid and other health programs. The change would make Medicaid, CHIP and Affordable Care Act coverage available to all legal immigrants who were previously eligible for it, such as refugees and people granted asylum. The Democratic proposal would not broaden eligibility to federally funded health care programs to immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Vance said the Democratic policies would ""give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens,"" and the White House did not offer its source for that figure. When Johnsonwas pressed to support a similar talking point, he referenced the Congressional Budget Office. An August KFFanalysisof CBOestimatesfound that the Republican law’s provisions related to legal immigrants would reduce federal spending by $131 billion; this projection did not include an estimate for people without legal status. Vance said, ""Democrats are threatening to shut down the entire government because they want to give hundreds of billions of dollars of health care benefits to illegal aliens."" Immigrants in the U.S. illegally are largely ineligible for federally funded health care programs Medicare and Medicaid, and they cannot seek coverage in the Affordable Care Act marketplace or apply for subsidies. The Democrats' budget proposal would not change that. The Democrats want to restore access to certain health care programs to legal immigrants who will lose access under the Republican tax and spending law — among other measures aimed at making Medicaid and Affordable Care Act insurance plans easier to keep. Their proposal would not grant federally supported health care benefits to people in the U.S. illegally, because they did not have access to them in the first place. The small amount of funding designated for Emergency Medicaid reimburses hospitals that provide emergency care to immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. Finally, we did not find evidence for Vance’s assertion that Democrats want ""hundreds of billions"" in health benefits for migrants in the country illegally.

"People with insurance through the Affordable Care Act will see a “75% increase in premiums starting Nov. 1” if enhanced subsidies are not extended, including “twice as much in the rural areas.”",Unknown,"By Louis Jacobson • September 30, 2025",mostly-true,0,"As Republicans and Democrats careened toward an Oct. 1 government shutdown, the parties clashed over whether to pass a clean extension of federal funding, as Republicans sought, or to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, as Democrats wanted. In aninterviewon CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" — aired Sept. 28, three days before government funding was set to run out — Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said that if Republicans failed to extend the expiring subsidies, many Americans would see a big hit in their out-of-pocket health insurance costs. Klobuchar said rural Americans, including farmers, would be hit disproportionately. ""Republicans have created a health care crisis,"" Klobuchar said. ""My constituents, Americans, are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So, Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late — a 75% increase in premiums starting Nov. 1 on people who are small business owners, people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas."" We previously rated the 75% talking pointMostly True. (The group that made that estimate subsequently upped it to 114%.) Klobuchar’s ""twice as much"" comparison can be interpreted in more than one way. By one of those readings — the one her office said she intended, that rural enrollees would see their out-of-pocket costs double — Klobuchar is correct. People who use the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces can buy health insurance from providers at various levels of coverage and varying premium costs. Most purchasers obtain subsidies, as long as they meet the income guidelines. In 2021, then-President Joe Biden signed legislation that made Affordable Care Act subsidies more generous. The law reduced the maximum amount purchasers would have to pay for coverage and enabled subsidies for households with incomes higher than 400% of the federal poverty level. Previously, the subsidies were capped at 400% of the poverty limit for a household. In 2024, that amounted to $60,240 for a one-person household. That figure increases depending on the number of people in the household. Congress renewed these enhanced subsidies in 2022 through the end of 2025, so they are now poised to expire. The subsidies proved popular. The number of people receiving themincreasedfrom 12 million in 2021 to 21.4 million in 2024, according to an analysis of federal data by KFF, a health care think tank. Using 2024 federal data, KFFcalculatedthe average annual premium for enrollees who received enhanced subsidies. The government paid $5,727 of the total premium under the original Affordable Care Act subsidy rules. Another $888 came out of the beneficiary’s pocket. The enhanced subsidy provision covered the final portion, $705. If the enhanced subsidy disappeared and the enrollee had to pay both the $888 and the $705 amounts, that would total $1,593. That’s about 79% more than the same person was paying with the enhanced subsidies in place — close to Klobuchar’s 75% figure. On Sept. 30, two days after Klobuchar’s remarks, KFFreleaseda new estimate that showed an even higher out-of-pocket increase of 114%, superseding the group’s previous 79% figure. There are at least two ways to interpret Klobuchar’s statement: that she was comparing rural enrollees' costs with people living elsewhere, or comparing their costs with what they paid before. Klobuchar’s office told PolitiFact that the senator referred to rural enrollees’ out-of-pocket costs doubling compared with what they would pay with a continuation of enhanced subsidies. (That aligns with what Klobuchar has said inothersettings.) This is accurate, according to an analysis by the Century Foundation, which describes itself as a ""progressive, independent think tank"" and which Klobuchar’s office told PolitiFact is the source of her talking point about rural impact, The Century Foundation analysis concluded that out-of-pocket insurance costs in rural counties would increase on average from $713 to $1,473 — a 107% increase, or slightly more than a doubling. By contrast, the increase for people in urban counties was 89%. But there’s less evidence to support the interpretation some might have drawn from Klobuchar’s statement: that rural enrollees would experience a hit twice as big as enrollees elsewhere. The Century Foundation analysis found that’s not the case. In its Augustanalysis, the Century Foundation separated out the impacts of expiring subsidies by several demographic factors, including whether a county is predominantly rural. The groupfoundthat enrollees in rural counties would, on average, see out-of-pocket increases of $760 from expiring enhanced subsidies, compared with $624 for all counties and $593 for urban counties. That means the rural increase would be 22% larger than the increase for enrollees overall, and 28% larger than the increase for urban enrollees. That amounts to a disproportionately large increase for rural areas, but not twice as much. Klobuchar said people with Affordable Care Act insurance will see a ""75% increase in premiums starting Nov. 1,"" if enhanced subsidies are not extended, including ""people who are farmers out there — twice as much in the rural areas."" A KFF analysis found that the disappearance of enhanced subsidies would increase out-of-pocket health care costs by an average of 79%, which is close to 75%. (KFF subsequently raised its estimate to 114%.) A Century Foundation analysis found that the increase in out-of-pocket costs for Affordable Care Act insurance wouldn’t be twice as big for rural enrollees, which is one way to interpret Klobuchar’s comment. The rural cost increase would be 22% bigger than for enrollees overall and 28% bigger than for urban enrollees. However, the way Klobuchar’s office said she intended the statement — that rural enrollees would pay twice as much out of pocket for their coverage than they did before an expiration of the enhanced subsidies — is accurate, because the study found that costs in rural counties would increase by 107%.

"“If the government shuts down, members of Congress still get paid. The janitors never get paid.”",Unknown,"By Amy Sherman • September 30, 2025",mostly-true,0,"Many federal government employees will forgo paychecks if the government shuts down Oct. 1. But that won’t be the case for lawmakers, a liberal podcaster said. ""If the government shuts down, members of Congress still get paid,"" said Dan Koh, host of ""The People’s Cabinet"" podcast in acliphe posted Sept. 29 on X. ""The janitors never get paid."" Koh, who worked as deputy assistant to former President Joe Biden, said in the clip that almost all janitors who work on federal property are employed by private contractors. ""There is no obligation, and Donald Trump, I guarantee you, has no intention of paying these janitors if the government shuts down,"" Koh said. ""So they get completely screwed. There is no back pay. They just get no money."" Democrats and Republicans are in abattleover whether to extend expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and reverse Medicaid cuts in must-pass legislation. If not resolved, it could lead to a government shutdown. Who gets paid and who doesn’t when the government shuts down? Congressdoes get paidduring a shutdown. Lawmakers have repeatedlyproposedbillsthat would stop that practice, but those measures have not become law. Members of Congress are not subject to furlough because oftheir constitutional responsibilities.Article I, Section 6of the Constitution says, ""Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States."" Member salaries have been provided by a permanent, mandatory appropriation fordecades. Most representatives and senators are paid$174,000a year. The only exceptions include the House speaker, who receives $223,500 annually, and the Senate president pro tempore and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate, who are each paid $193,400 a year. Employees are not paid during a shutdown, including those who are deemed essential and must report to work. These include many immigration enforcement workers and Transportation Security Administration agents at airports. A2019 federal lawsays employees furloughed as a result of a lapse in appropriations as well as those required to work without pay receive back pay. But the law makes no mention of contractors. What about Koh’s assertion that janitors ""never"" get paid amid a shut down? We found no definitive information on janitors employed by contractors, but labor and employment lawyers and federal budget experts said contractors are often not paid. Jim Malatras, chief strategy officer at The Fedcap Group, a nonprofit that has federal janitorial and custodial contracts that employ people with disabilities, told PolitiFact that the company will continue to pay its employees if there’s a government shutdown ""while we have the funding to do so."" Charlotte Hoffman, spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., said not every contracted employee automatically gets furloughed without pay. It’s up to each federal agency to stop its contracts; most are stopped. Contracting companies can choose whether to continue to pay their employees. Most janitors are contracted and face furloughs, but that situation may not apply to every person who works on a federal contract, Hoffman said. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that tracks federal spending,recently wrotethat ""federal contractors have historically not received back pay."" The group added that ""federal contractors sometimes include premiums in their bids to account for uncertainty in being paid."" Most contractor employees are not considered by the federal government to be essential, and the contractor decides whether to allow them to take paid time off or use furloughs or layoffs, said Nichole D. Atallah, a partner at PilieroMazza law firm in Washington, D.C. ""The government generally does not pay contractors for wages employees would have otherwise earned had they worked,"" Atallah said. JacksonLewis, a national employment and labor law firm,wrotein 2023 that past government shutdowns have led to a permanent loss of income for many federal government contractors. Lawyerscautionthat not every contract is the same. The government has said in the past that in the absence of appropriations, agencies must limit obligations to those needed to protect life and property. In 2023, some Senate Democrats including Smith proposed abillto pay federal contractors some back pay, but itdid not advance. Smith is working on a similar proposal in the event of a shutdown. Koh said, ""If the government shuts down, members of Congress still get paid. The janitors never get paid."" Members of the House and Senate continue to get paid during a shutdown. Federal law says that federal employees get back pay, but the law does not extend that to contractors, a group that includes many janitors. Some private employers with federal contracts may find ways to pay their employees, but there is nothing in federal law that requires it. We rate this statement Mostly True.

"""Republicans have effectively ended medical research in the United States of America.""",Unknown,"By Louis Jacobson • September 29, 2025",barely-true,0,"President Donald Trump has made historically large cuts to medical research, some of them aimed at ending what he refers to asdiversity, equity and inclusionin federally funded studies. His administration is proposing more: Overall funding for the National Institutes of Healthwould returnto its2007 levelif Trump’s budget proposal were to be enacted. A recent New York Times story highlighted Trump’s billions in proposed National Cancer Institute cuts and carried the headline, ""Trump Is Shutting Down the War on Cancer."" In the midst of a fight with Republicans over spending and a possible government shutdown, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to cut back medical research funding during a Q&A with reporters. ""Republicans have effectively ended medical research in the United States of America,"" JeffriessaidSept. 24. Has the Trump administration really ended medical research? While a substantial amount has disappeared, and more could be on the way out if Trump gets his way, Jeffries exaggerated the outlook, even allowing for his ""effectively"" caveat. Billions of dollars would remain even in the most austere scenario, and there’s uncertainty about whether his most severe proposed cuts will receive congressional approval. Even after proposing substantial cuts to the budget of the National Institutes of Health — the main engine funding U.S. medical research — Trump’s proposal would give the institutes $27 billion for fiscal year 2026. And Trump’s proposal is not final; Congress could increase that amount. Some experts call that scenario likely. ""The appropriations language making its way through Congress is much less draconian, so it may be too early to know where all this is going to land,"" said Richard Frank, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Jeffries’ office did not provide additional evidence for his statement. Trump’s cuts so far take several forms, said Joshua Weitz, a University of Maryland biology professor who co-founded theScience and Community Impacts Mapping Project, which is tracking the impacts of federal funding cuts nationally. Some of these cutbacks are being challenged in court. Weeks after Trump’s inauguration, the National Institutes of Healthannouncedmajor cuts to ""indirect costs"" —  funds that pay for facilities, safety and grant administration. It capped indirect costs for labs working on NIH grants at 15%. Previously, theaverage ratewas about 28%, and sometimes above 60%, according to NIH. Weitz says a more appropriate calculation — one that measures indirect costs as a share of direct costs, rather than as a share of total costs — would make the historic rate higher, 42%. The White House has terminatedthousands of research grants worth approximately $5 billion. Some of these were canceled for beingrelated to diversity, equity and inclusion, a top target of the administration,such asa $3.8 million Asian Bipolar Genetics Network study to a $1.05 million Alzheimer’s and dementia study focusing on Black Americans. Others were related to administration efforts to punish elite universities for allegedly allowing antisemitism on campus, leading tohiring freezesand holds onclinical trials, Harvard University economist David Cutler and Harvard economist Edward Glaeser co-wrote a recentpaperin JAMA Health Forum. ""A fraction of these grants have been reinstated, but science does not turn on and off like a spigot,"" Weitz said. ""Interrupting research leads to wasted studies, risks projects, and is already causing job loss."" Through early April, the NIHousted1,200 employees, and granted anunknown numberof retirements and resignations. At the Food and Drug Administration, which approves drugs, thousands of jobs have beeneliminated. The president’s budget proposalwould cutNIH funding from about $45 billion to about $27 billion. That’s a roughly 39% cut for a budget item that in recent decades has almost always increased from year to year. The proposed budget would eliminate the National Institutes for Nursing Research, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the Fogarty International Center, and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. NIH represents the lion’s share ofmedical research funding, but the administration is also proposing cuts to other agencies that are part of the medical research network. These include theAdvanced Research Projects Agency for Health, for which the administration proposes a $555 million cut; theCenter for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which would lose a proposed $361 million; andCongressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, which could lose its entire $650 million budget under Trump’s proposal. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which funds or undertakes some research, would see its overall budget fall by almost $5 billion, or more than half. The consequences of these cuts could be significant. ""Our research shows that while cutting NIH funding may appear to save money in the short term, it cantrigger a chain of effectsthat increase long-term health care costs and slow the development of new treatments and public health solutions over time,"" Harvard University health policy and data specialists Mohammad S. Jalali and Zeynep Hasgülwrotefor The Conversation. Between 2010 and 2019, all but two of the 356 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration received some NIH funding,one study found. So any cuts could reduce the number of drugs in the pipeline, experts say. Once all the follow-on impacts reverberate throughout the U.S. economy and health care system, the cuts could prompt an ""$8 trillion health care catastrophe,"" Cutler and Glaeserwrote. They estimated that the losses from reduced health would be 16 times greater than the proposed budgetary savings. The cuts are extensive but do not end U.S. medical research. Trump’s slashed NIH budget wouldstill spendmore than $27 billion in fiscal year 2026. ""Novel biomedical discoveries that enhance health and lengthen life are more vital than ever to our country’s future,"" the agency said in its budget proposal. ""NIH research is critical to protect national security and sustain the United States’ scientific competitiveness, globally."" The president’s proposal highlighted initiatives on nutrition, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, autism, and cancer, all priorities of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The FDA would receive a 3.8%budgetary cutunder Trump’s budget proposal, to almost $6.8 billion. Despite the Republican majority’s generally close alignment with Trump’s policy agenda, Congress is on record rejecting his proposed medical research cuts, at least in the preliminary stage. TheSenateandHouseappropriations committees have voted for modest increases in NIH’s budget rather than Trump’s large cuts. They also voted to fund CDC and FDA at higher levels than Trump set out in his budget proposal. These increases are not guaranteed; they will have to go through negotiations between lawmakers and the president before final passage. ""Congress is likely to approve much smaller cuts than the Administration had proposed,"" said Sherry Glied, a professor at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Jeffries said, ""Republicans have effectively ended medical research in the United States of America."" Trump has proposed severe cuts to medical research at the National Institutes of Health and other agencies, including caps on indirect costs for grantees’ labs, terminated grant funding and staff reductions. But this is not tantamount to effectively ending U.S. medical research. Even if Trump gets his way on a 39% cut to NIH’s budget in 2026, the institutes would still have more than $27 billion to spend in fiscal year 2026. Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress may not go along with cuts on the scale the president proposed. Appropriations committees in both the Senate and the House have already rejected Trump’s steep cuts on medical research. Trump’s medical research cuts are real and sweeping, but they have not ""effectively ended medical research."" We rate the statement Mostly False. UPDATE, Oct. 1, 2025: This article has been updated to provide more detail from Joshua Weitz about the previous level of NIH’s indirect costs. CORRECTION, Oct. 3, 2025: Trump’s budget proposal includes a 3.8%cutfor the FDA.
